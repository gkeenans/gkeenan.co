I’ve been thinking a lot lately.

That feels like a silly thing to declare. I don’t know if I can recall a moment in my life where I’ve not been burdened by thought. Overthought. Languishing by my lonesome within an unquiet mind. Thinking keeps my brain busy, but it is wholly unproductive. Relentless criticism, second-guessing every decision, worrying. Always worrying. I never imagined the defining characteristic of my adulthood would be neuroticism. Each moment that passes is a new opportunity to obsess and ruminate and relinquish any agency for how I can productively spend my time, instead finding myself as a passenger riding a rollercoaster of my mind’s creation, a structure that defies physics and logic and twists itself into an incomprehensible, garbled mess of steel and wood and screaming and doubt and despair and drops and turns and weightlessness and the greatest weight a single human can withstand, all of this at once separate and inextricably linked and layered and indiscernible from the rest.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately.

I want to chalk it up to the fact that for the past year an **actual fucking pandemic** has woven itself into the fabric of our lives. Knowledge of its existence permeates each waking hour (which there are many more of because what even is normal sleep anymore). COVID dictates how we live, who we see, how we exist in a world to which we had grown accustomed. Going to the grocery store is a danger now. Talking to other people outside of the confines of a computer screen is a potentially perilous activity. Hugging your parents could be a death sentence for them, for you, or for someone you’ve never met but you just happened to be in the same room as them for a length of time. I recognize how much fear dictates my perspective. I probably have nothing to worry about getting sick. I wonder how many of the 2.85 million people (as of this writing) who have died thought, “It’s no big deal.” I wonder how many of the over 555,000 Americans thought, “This is no worse than the flu,” as they gasped their last breath, lungs crippled by a hoax.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately.

I want to chalk it up to the fact that a majority of the last decade has been shaped by the frequent assaults of a racist, authoritarian, narcissistic tyrant who decided he needed to heal his bruised ego by running for one of the most powerful leadership positions in the world. How we’ve had to watch him stumble and bumble and fumble his way through pretending to be President, leaving a wake of chaos wherever he tread, damning our people to oppression to appease his sycophantic whims. Destroying families. Imprisoning children. Treating human beings as animals destined to experience an undefined amount of their life relegated to **actual fucking cages**. This monstrous blob that inexplicably gained sentience, procreated, and decided to slither around, covering everything in a thick, gummy sludge we’ll spend decades trying to wipe off completely, if and only if the despicable ghouls that enabled his rise to power in the first place don’t get another chance to wreak havoc in four years.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately.

I want to chalk it up to growth, maturity, learning to not give a shit. The realization that no one’s opinion of me matters more than my opinion of myself. I have nothing to prove—approval is not a currency that my self-esteem even trades in anymore. It took thirty-ish years to accomplish, but I’ve finally established an equilibrium where I can be satisfied with just being me. 

I’ve been thinking a lot lately, about all of this, and how it’s affected what I put out into the world. I used to find an outlet in writing. I could set myself free to explore and scrutinize and solidify my thoughts. Writing helped me mold the chaotic, ephemeral wisps flitting around in my brain and let them congeal into an approximation of truth. It was me. I was whole. 

I’m not anymore. 

And the truth that congeals as I write this out now is that it’s not that I’m overburdened by worry of a global pandemic. Likewise, the political tumult in the U.S. leading up to and proceeding the 2016 Presidential election didn’t somehow sap my ability to express myself. And let’s not kid ourselves, I have never been more acutely aware of other people’s perception of me. Honestly, in the last five years, I’ve regressed to a state that feels more reminiscent of the teenage angst and worry that defined my high school persona. The difference, of course, is that at least then I still _tried_. I'm too comfortable to even try now. Why bother wasting my time? Who needs to hear from me? Who gives a shit? Why am I pouring $100 per year into maintaining this dumb fucking website?

At 35 years old, I care more about the approval of others than at any other time in my life. It's paralyzing. 

The last time I [wrote at length](https://gkeenan.co/writing/what-is-happening) about my mental state in an attempt to make sense of what was going on in the perilous shitstorm that is my brain, I managed to uncover a brief moment of optimism:

> To be frank, I have no fucking clue where I'm going. I'm fumbling around in the dark. I'm taking things one day at a time. I can't rely on my brain to treat me well at any particular moment, but today... Today is the day I get this shit out of my head and be honest with myself that there's something I desperately need to overcome before I can ever hope to return to normalcy. I thought I was writing this to try and shed some light on what's been going on with me and this site for the past year or so, but I think I'm writing this now more to hold myself accountable during a period of lucidity. To publish it is to document the struggle. Hopefully I can look back on this somewhere down the line and see it as a turning point, even if I'm more convinced that this is but a brief respite before I reach the nadir.

I’m sad to report that, over four years later, I’ve published four whole pieces. I’ve thought about and trashed numerous drafts that will never see the light of day. My lack of creativity is something that still haunts me on a daily basis.

This stands in stark contrast to the fact that my life improved in immeasurable ways—I distanced myself from a toxic marriage and a toxic relationship with my last job. I fell in love with and married my best friend, and we have the most fulfilling relationship I’ve ever experienced. I am in a place where I actually _want_ to put in the work and become the best version of myself. I’ve frankly never been in a better place mentally, even with all of the existential dread related to… well, you know.

But there’s still something missing. A void in my being impossible to ignore, and yet I can’t bring myself to fill it. 

I’ve toiled with this conundrum for as long as I can remember, but it’s only in the last few years that my fear of the void manifests in avoidance. Better to displace. Better to distract. Better to distance myself from it, for acknowledging it only hurts more. Shut it out completely, rather than try and coexist with it.

Suppressing the void doesn’t diminish its hunger. It finds something else to feed upon. It’s at its hungriest when I’m trying to quiet it with yet another video game, or with endless scrolling through Twitter, or YouTube, or watching movies. Not that any of those activities carries any inherent negativity in my mind, but I have to admit that, for me, they’re oftentimes more of a crutch to keep my brain busy. The more I consume, the more I have to consume. The alternative to consumption is creation, and I can’t be bothered at this point. It’s too much work, and it’s too devastating to let myself down again. I can’t let the void win.

Recently, in my routine void avoidance, I came across a Tweet that changed me. That… sounds dramatic, but it’s the closest amalgamation of truth I can muster in this moment.

I haven’t stopped thinking about this for nearly a month.

> I think that most of us really want to offer the world something of quality, something that the world will consider good or important. 

Ethan Hawke says as he stares into my fucking soul.

> And that’s really the enemy, because it’s not up to us whether what we do is any good, and if history has taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic.

And so I clicked through and watched a [TED Talk of Ethan Hawke](https://youtu.be/WRS9Gek4V5Q) waxing poetic about creativity, where he spoke directly to me and only to me for nine whole minutes. He opens with a punch to my gut:

> A lot of people really struggle to give themselves permission to be creative. And reasonably so, I mean, we’re all a little suspect of our own talent.

Drag me through the mud, O captain.

I’ve devoted so much time to rumination in my adult years, expecting at the end of it I would somehow have the permission to go out and write or _whatever_ it is I want to do to create. If I wait for just the right amount of inspiration. If I muster up just enough courage. If I think about something just enough to where it is perfect and everyone will love it…

A quick diversion: when I left my job last year after seven years at the company, I joined a Slack for former employees. It didn’t take long to discover that a small group of my former colleagues had spent time discussing me, in particular, and it was readily apparent that those participating in the discussion did not hold me in high regard. 

I was devastated. Partially because I liked most of these people, and I had no idea that they felt this way about me. I thought we had been on good terms, and to this day I still can’t recall a negative interaction I had with them. I’m ignorant to what I did to hurt them, and that kills me. I had spent seven years prior trying to make sure “my brand” at work was one of positivity—I believed in the culture of the company we were building, and I wanted my interactions with my peers to reflect that. Despite that, I had clearly failed somewhere with these individuals. It reminded me of all those times growing up where I worried what people were saying about me behind my back. It turns out, in this case, it was pretty cruel. My worst nightmare of my childhood come to life.

Of the things that were said about me, the one that stuck with me the most was from someone I respected and admired. Someone I truly thought liked me. Their perception of me was that I was “a nice guy” who happened to be “a part of the cult.” They insinuated that the only reason I was happy working at that company was because I “didn’t have to have any opinions.” Without thinking, they had fashioned an off-handed remark into a scythe and sliced me in half.

I could rationalize the behavior of the others by recognizing the undeniable fact that you can’t please everyone. Despite the fact that I always believed that I could, it makes logical sense to me that despite my best efforts, there will be some people whose personalities do not mix with mine. It sucks, but it’s the truth. All I can do is try to be kind and hope for the best.

However, the idea that I thrived at this company because I “didn’t have to have any opinions” ruined me. I could distance myself from the ignorant cruelty of the others, but that comment rattled me—so much so that I knew I had to address it with this person or it would eat me alive. I wrote them a heartfelt letter (which sounds way more official and interesting than saying I DM’d them on Twitter) describing the pain it caused me. I received a response less than a day later. They apologized profusely and acknowledged how cruel and thoughtless it was. I deeply appreciated their willingness to confront this hurt with me, and it made me realize that this respect and admiration I had for them was not misplaced. It wasn’t difficult to forgive them.

But it was impossible to forget the comment that sundered me, leaving my innards spilled out and baking in the sun, beasts picking the carrion clean off my bones as I slowly rotted away. The pain it inflicted lingers to this day. I’m still angry. I mean, fuck, I'm writing about it over a year later. Who am I kidding?

It’s not anger at this particular person. It’s anger at me, because it’s something I’ve seen in myself as I’ve grown older. Not an inability to have opinions; an inability to share them, to trust myself. A fear of expressing my opinions. A fear of ruffling feathers. A fear of repurcussions. A fear that I was wrong, that I was uninformed, that I was stupid and lacked the critical thinking abilities necessary to form the thought in the first place. I second-guess myself constantly, and the exhaustion I feel as a result compels me to stay silent. I’m so afraid to be fully me that I displace, distract, distance. Creativity was collateral damage. To be creative is to have a point of view and use that to say something about your experiences. I’ve been so afraid of having a point of view, that it has starved me of my ability to be say anything.

I am angry because this person was right.

> That’s really the enemy, because it’s not up to us whether what we do is any good, and if history has taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic.

Ethan Hawke knows. I have been so obsessed with this notion of being “right”—making something “good”—that I wait and I consider and I hope and I plan and I think and I think and I think and I think and I think and I think and I think and I think.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about how I think too much and it’s obliterated my drive to do fucking _anything_ of substance. I'm so worried about the ramifications of not being right that I don't even try to _get it right_. I stop myself at think and never get to do.

> Most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about poetry. Right? They have a life to live, and they’re not really that concerned with Allen Ginsberg’s poems or anybody’s poems… until their father dies, they go to a funeral, you lose a child, somebody breaks your heart, they don’t love you anymore, and all of a sudden, you’re desperate for making sense out of this life, and “Has anybody ever felt this bad before? How did they come out of this cloud?” Or the inverse—something great. You meet somebody and your heart explodes. You love them so much, you can’t even see straight. You know, you’re dizzy. “Did anybody feel like this before? What is happening to me?” **And that**’**s when art**’**s not a luxury, it's actually sustenance. We need it.**

Writing, for me, is a way to make sense out of life. At a certain point, I stopped trying to make sense out of what was happening and just let it happen _to_ me. I'm the happiest I have been in years, and yet there's this void that is impossible to fill. It takes and it takes, because I'm not giving it sustenance. I'm drained because I'm so afraid that I am not good enough.

And I am tired of this idea I’ve instilled in myself that creativity alone is not good enough. I don’t hold anyone else to that fucking standard. Just me and all of my endless thoughts.

Fuck it. If I don’t publish this I never will, so I’m going to publish it.

Good enough.
