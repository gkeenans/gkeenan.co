A fun fact I learned: today, July 14, is International Non-Binary People’s Day. This is particularly serendipitous because I have recently come to terms with the fact that I’ve long struggled in my relationship with the gender binary—and through an arduous process of self-discovery, I realize at 35 years of age that I identify as a non-binary person. My pronouns are they/them. 

Hello.

Identity has always been a tricky subject for me. Depending on your familiarity with my writing, you might have an inkling that I am in a constant state of self-assessment, desperately scrutinizing every last emotional whim for some semblance of deeper connection to who I am. What it means to be me. How the world sees me. How I see me.

How I can be proud of me. For my sake.

For an excrutiatingly long time, I quietly interrogated gender norms within myself. I was socialized male growing up, but I never felt fully comfortable hanging out with other boys. I was a “boy,” and later a “man,” because the language we had to help us relate to our mere existence was defined by rigidity driven primarily by our over-simplified understanding of birth sex—humans, by nature, long for simple nomenclature, but it’s remarkable how woefully ill-prepared that predisposition leaves us when navigating the reality of the world and its seven billion people. 

But here I was, a quiet, shy, sensitive boy. Quick to cry. Easy to pick on. Ostracized. My upbringing wasn’t particularly tumultuous in the grand scheme of things, I admit, but it’s the experience I had. It was the world I knew. I didn’t have many friends, and the friends I felt closest to were most often girls. Even when I was young, my longing for vulnerability always sat better with the women in my life. 

Despite some of the close friendships, the thing I remember most about growing up was loneliness. Self-imposed isolation, befriended by a rich imagination, the Internet, and video games—lots of video games.

Some things never change.

But some things do! Leaving home to move to Chicago allowed me to learn a bit more about me. In a city of three million or so people, I was exposed to a much wider array of personalities and perspectives, and my years in college gave me crucial insight into who I am. A serviceable writer. A good listener. A performer! Turns out, I loved public speaking. I loved entertaining people on stage, in the spotlight, turning written word into spectacle. The shy, quiet boy evolved into a shy, quiet man who knew when to flip on the switch and give people a little more of himself. 

And he was also angry. And anxious. And sad. And he didn’t know how to reconcile those feelings in a healthy way, so he let things simmer, boil, until the froth overran, coated the pot in a sickly bubbling foam and dripped into the flame causing it to shoot up and scorch those close enough to witness it.

Anger was always my Achilles heel. It’s how I interacted with the world when I felt helpless, alone, disappointed. I inherited it from my father, and, as a result, it’s the thing that I most closely associate with my relationship to my masculinity. I grow a great beard, and I have a pleasant, deep voice, but the thing I associate most with my manhood is the thing I am most appalled by in myself: rage.

In the last five years or so, I’ve softened. Not by happenstance, but by deliberate action. Leaving a marriage where I was deeply unhappy. Putting time and effort into therapy. Reconciling my relationship to work, creativity, and people. I feel more complete and comfortable with myself at 35 than I ever have. I’m not devoid of anger, but my relationship to it has changed.

My relationship to masculinity has not. While men are increasingly seen and treated as complex beings with a plethora of emotions, many of which are healthy and desirable, my perception of men is defined by toxicity. Anger. Entitlement. Stoicism. Stubbornness. Resentment. Force. Brutality. It’s a reality I’ve never felt comfortable existing in, and it’s a label I’ve never liked associating myself with. So I don’t. I’m more comfortable figuring out who I am in the shades of gray.

There’s a bigger conversation going on in the world right now. We’re empowering each other with new language, tools, and support to help us relate more effectively to our own identities, our own bodies, our own, colorful, wondrous, unique experiences. We’re affording people a level of kindness for themselves that we’ve never seen before. I couldn’t be more elated. How wonderful it is to be present in this moment in time when we’re giving people the words with which to write their own stories. The way in which we’ve seen change sweep across our culture is remarkable. There’s still much to do. There’s still pain. Still injustice. Still a severe lack of dignity given to those who deserve it. But there’s hope. It doesn’t take long to scroll down on this site and read cynical aphorisms about the Internet writ large, but I will be forever grateful to it for accelerating change and allowing people the connection to themselves and others like them.

I struggled for a long time thinking about how I could explain my relationship to gender, whether my voice even belonged in the conversation. Knowing that people have struggled for so long, and who don’t have the same safety or privilege as I do, quelled my own exploration. I turned my attention elsewhere, to more concrete presentations of me: my love of writing, gaming, acting, photography… not to mention the largely meaningless work I produce for the companies that pay me. I assumed as a cis-presenting white male that I didn’t have a story worth telling. I’d have to ignore my discomfort with how society assumed I existed on the gender spectrum, as my concern largely resided in assuring I wasn’t co-opting or trivilializing the stories of those who faced struggles unlike my own, who presented differently than I did, who experienced dysmorphia and a disconnection from their bodies that I just couldn’t comprehend. 

My wife, in her seemingly infinite, relentless wisdom, helped provide context for why I shouldn’t be so hard on myself. “There isn’t a finite bucket,” she said. “Your experience doesn’t trivialize the experience of another. Your experience is valid and how you identify is unique to you. It adds another shade to the spectrum. It doesn’t detract from the stories of others.”

And so… I’m here. Sharing a story. Mine. One that eschews any adherence to the black and white label that our ingrained lust for categorical shortcuts demand. Adding to a tapestry we’re collectively creating together by being who we deserve to be. Complicated. Unique. Beautiful.

I feel comfortable now, recognizing that I can fully explore who I am as I want to be. A freedom to be they. To be them.

To be me.
