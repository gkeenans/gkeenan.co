At this point, we’re all aware of the shenanigans happening at Reddit.

Right?

Like, I don’t even need to post a link to anything?

Fuck, I don’t even think I know where to send you at this point. I could choose [any one of hundreds of stories](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754780/reddit-api-updates-changes-news-announcements), but it feels like the Reddit news pustule is a fountain of infinite discharge, relentlessly oozing, so much so that by the time you’re caught up, a new layer has seeped out before the old has had a chance to crust over. Might as well bookmark that link, since there seems to be an antiseptic shortage.

It’s disheartening to see the leaders of overvalued tech companies tripping over themselves to out-stupid one another in an endless quest to suckle at the teat of Capitalism (although it is nice to see that every once in awhile they [_go to fucking prison_](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/30/1178728092/elizabeth-holmes-prison-sentence-theranos-fraud-silicon-valley)_)_. Steve Huffman isn’t the last ill-suited idiot to lead a company by over-inflating the importance of short-term gains instead of long-term prosperity, booping his doofy head on every goddamn branch during his slow-motion fall out of the Mighty Oak of Mediocre Leadership, and he won’t be the last.

He _is_, however, the current public face of a company employing a woefully malformed strategy that has a familiar _musk_ to it: cash in all of the goodwill you have in an effort to scrape your way out of a very bad decision you made, regardless of the cost. In this case, the cost being destroying the trust of the thousands of volunteer moderators who try to keep your site from devolving into a complete and utter toxic hellscape (or Twitter, for short), not to mention showing your whole entire ass to hundreds of thousands of your website’s most devoted and active contributors (read: the reason your website has any value whatsoever in the first place), causing them to not only gleefully join in a protest that effectively kills the usefulness of your website, but who also plan to quit using the site long-term, leaving only a husk in its place that no awful redesign will be ever be able to cover up.

All of this, it seems to me, because he’s worried he’s running out of time to capitalize on an IPO in a volatile and stupid market. What other explanation is there?

I’m not going to pretend like I was the world’s biggest Reddit user. My engagement with it ebbed and flowed over the years, but I _had_ been there since 2011. It _was_ a site I used basically every day, typically multiple times a day, to be entertained, to learn something new, to get a consensus on current events, to participate in communities built around things that I loved.

And also to soothe my health anxiety when Google convinced me that I have cancer.

But I quit without second thought.[^1] My main account and throwaways. Poof. Gone. Like a fart in the wind.

Steve Huffman’s relentless campaign to be the most unlikable tech dipshit over the last few weeks ([previous infractions](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/23/reddit-huffman-trump/) notwithstanding) showed me that Reddit is not long for this world, and it’s not worth staying to watch it fall apart around me. It won’t just collapse overnight, obviously. We couldn’t be that lucky. It’ll flail about, desperate to prove it still has purpose. It may even IPO so its investors can try and recoup their costs. And, surely, the dumbest days are still ahead of it. But there’s no future for Reddit while it’s helmed by an immature dingus who decided [he wanted to emulate the world’s richest piece of shit](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-blackout-protest-private-ceo-elon-musk-huffman-rcna89700).

I think it’s fair to say that Capitalism has broken the brains of business leaders, and it’s no more apparent to me than in instances like this, where inept, petty dullards desperate for their slice of the pie are forced into peacocking for each other, convinced their brilliant display will prove to the world that _no, really! They’re humble geniuses!_ When the reality is that they’re just braindead frat boys running around with their pants at their ankles, high on the scent of their own festering mediocrity.

It’d be hilarious if it also didn’t mean the people they’re exploiting along the way are getting fucked in the process, but I guess that’s just the price of doing business.


[^1]: I think what’s especially ironic here is that _I wasn’t even an Apollo user!_ I was a sucker who used the official iOS app and the “new” website. I put up with obnoxious ads, algorithmic fuckery, the forcefeeding of content Reddit _thought_ I was interested in but wasn’t, and the inevitable, ugh, pivot to video. Every app is TikTok now.
