Allison Johnson, writing for [_The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/23768630/motorola-razr-plus-40-ultra-review-screen-battery-camera):

> [The Motorola Razr Plus](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23744843/motorola-razr-plus-2023-screen-price-cameras) is the first folding phone that makes me genuinely excited for what’s ahead. In the here and now, it’s a good device, though not quite as ready for the mainstream as Motorola wants you to believe. But for a specific kind of tech-inclined person willing to try out something new, the Razr Plus will be very rewarding.

It needs to be said that I have, by and large, been a real folding phone detractor. I have never seen the point, and the tradeoffs have been far too large to even consider jumping over. I mean… _Android?_ Ew. _Samsung???_ Literally kill me. Chop me up into little tiny bits and stuff those bits in a box and throw the bits in a box into a volcano.

It _also_ needs to be said, first and foremost, that I am maybe just a little bit, kinda but not really, but also, yes, if I am being completely honest I would have to say that I am falling out of love with phones.

Maybe I’m falling out of love with gadgets on the whole. I dunno, my relationship with technology is fucking weird. Like, I’m still reading _The Verge_ after all, but also am I _enjoying_ reading _The Verge_? Yes and no. Do I really care about any of this shit?

On the one hand, I _am_ writing about it… so, yes.

… But also no?

My wishy-washy ass is sitting here, looking at my iPhone 13 Pro and thinking, “I’ve been an iPhone user since the iPhone 4 came to Verizon. Apple is embedded into my life in a significant way. I don’t have the _reverence_ for Apple and their devices that I used to, but I sure do trust the overall experience far more than any other company. The cost of switching to anything else at this point seems too damn high, and I’ve really never enjoyed using an Android device…

Hmm. Maybe I should make that citrus-braised pork shoulder for supper club on Saturday…”

Anyway, _the point_: at this stage in my life, my iPhone serves as a glorified camera (which is important—I’m a photographer and I like what the iPhone camera enables me to do). I spend a lot of time dicking around on this device, don’t get me wrong, but _I really don’t want to anymore_. I think I would like something that created a bit more of a barrier between picking up the phone and _using_ the phone.

Like, maybe Apple should add a feature to Screen Time that makes it so any time you unlock your device, there’s a chance it explodes. Not a big chance. But, like, 10%. I dunno.

Call it Face IED.[^1]

Or—_or!—hear me out!_ Folding screen. Shrink down this gleaming monolith into something less enticing to use. Make it just that much more obnoxious to access the big dopamine projector. _Save me from myself_.[^2]

Look, I’m just gonna say it. I don’t think the RAZR+ makes any fucking sense. If I dig down real deep into the most rational part of my brain, I still don’t see the point in foldable devices period. I really don’t. At least not right now. And I definitely don’t want to jump over to a new operating system. I don’t want to have to learn a new camera. I don’t want to deal with that weird little lip on the middle of screen where the hinge closes, regardless of how noticeable it is while I’m using it. I don’t want to think to myself every time I go to open it, “Is this going to be the time that the display breaks because this tech is still new and underbaked?”

I don’t even know if the tech is underbaked, but that’s _the perception_ that I have, and it would permeate my every waking moment if I was walking around with this thing.

_But… this still does look kinda fucking cool??_ This is the first time any device outside of the Apple ecosystem has made me stop and think, “Huh! _Maybe…”_ That alone feels pretty triumphant. Now, I might be more inclined, from an I-would-like-to-actually-accomplish-my-goal-of-not-using-my-phone-as-much perspective, to go with the regular [RAZR](https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/motorola-razr-2023-render-summer-lilac.jpg), but the recovering gadget slut in me scoffs at the specs and gets a little indignant about going with the “less powerful” phone. It feels stupid even typing that, like, motherfucker _this would help you_, but whatever.

_Whatever!_ Phones are dumb and boring.

But I want one.

No, I don’t.

Yes, I do.[^3]

[^1]: Tim, you can have that one for free.

[^2]: I actually have real-life anecdata to support this! I was getting my car detailed a few weeks ago, and the owner of the business had a Samsung Galaxy Fold. I had literally never seen one in real life, so I asked him about it, and he laughed and said, “Yeah, it is \[a Fold\]. I never use the big screen. I just always use it closed.” … _What???_ Just think if there was an even smaller screen on the front—OR NO SCREEN AT ALL! We could save people from this eternal damnation that is being beholden to these tiny little metal and glass parasites! Also, in all seriousness, it is absolutely fucking hilarious to me that this person had a Galaxy Fold and just kept it closed. Like… Okay, so you just have a really chunky ass normal Android phone. Lmao. He thought it was funny, too.

[^3]: Apropos of nothing, but my dog farted herself awake three times while I wrote this piece, and I thought it was extremely funny. I long for a life as simple as that. Forget folding phones, someone transfer my consciousness into a Basenji.
