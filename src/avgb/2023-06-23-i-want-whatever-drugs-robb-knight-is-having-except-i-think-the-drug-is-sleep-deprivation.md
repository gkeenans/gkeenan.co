Classy human and builder of a beautiful website that is [_very much my shit, oh my god, I love it, seriously, just look at his_ **_logo_**](https://rknight.me), Robb Knight, writing in a brief piece entitled [_The Biology of the Hey Bear Fruits Makes No Sense_](https://rknight.me/biology-of-hey-bear-fruits/) that is very much worth your time:

> A single orange, in the Hey Bear cinematic universe, is actually two creatures. The face is on the fleshy inside of each half but how did they get like that? Does a bigger fruit, or a human perhaps, have to cut them in half so they can see and talk and do whatever a living orange half does? What happens if said cutter slices off-centre, does one of them die while the other stays alive but has a part of their sibling's face on theirs, forever haunted by the memory.

Anyway, I couldn’t be more elated that someone like Robb has chosen to reproduce—just look at the results his journey into parenthood has yielded thus far! I’m very excited to see what madness might arise from repeated exposure to children’s media over an extended period of time.

(But in all seriousness: Robb. Hey, buddy. You good?)
