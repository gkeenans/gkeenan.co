In another episode of my new series _You cannot convince me that Capitalism doesn’t absolutely shatter the brains of those that benefit the most from it_: two of the world’s richest dumbasses are [taunting each other into punching it out in a cage](https://www.thewrap.com/ufc-president-mark-zuckerberg-elon-musk-fight/).

***This is a thing that is really happening in reality right now.***[^1] 

Our premier Elmer’s Glue cosplayer and the human embodiment of the Uncanny Valley, Mark Zuckerberg, and 13 year-old edgelord trapped in the body of a very stupid _51 year-old man_, Elon Musk, want to slap at each other’s moist, supple bodies for… what, exactly? Because Meta’s launching a Twitter competitor? Because Musk communicates exclusively by Neuralinking his id to his Twitter account and just letting it go buckwild?

It doesn’t matter the reason. The result is that _everything is so fucking stupid right now_.

Billionaires building rockets. Billionaires building submarines. Billionaires buying social media companies. Billionaires gettin’ swole. Billionaires having very public and very embarrassing midlife crises. Billionaires who will do absolutely everything instead of going to therapy. Billionaires with an insatiable lust for validation that would make even the angstiest of teens take a step back and go, “Bruh, you good?” Billionaires doing every possible thing (including trying to build a cybernetic implant for your fucking _brain, are you serious??_) with their time and money except making the world even a slight bit less shitty than when they arrived.

Why does anyone revere these fuckheads? Why in the world would someone, for a second, look at any of them and think, “Yeah. That’s that aspirational shit. Mmm. Inject it into my veins.”

Look, there’s really no one more deserving of a good old fashioned punch to the head than Elon Musk, and so if the end result of this is him getting rekt by a person who looks like a classical painting restoration mishap, I’m all for it.

As long as the cage they fight in is locked, and neither of them can exit until the other is unconscious.

And also the cage is placed on a pool of lava.


[^1]: I really don’t want to be one of those people who is constantly like, “Oh my god, aren’t there more important things to worry about??” But also, like, _AREN’T THERE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT?_ I feel like I’m losing my fucking mind! The world is burning. People are losing their jobs and their livelihoods and their lives. THE WORLD IS ON FIRE. And we’re really, truly going to let any modicum of our attention get taken over by the puerile peacocking of two rich dipshits with too much fucking time on their hands? Really? Are you fucking kidding me? What is wrong with everyone??? _Oh my god!_
