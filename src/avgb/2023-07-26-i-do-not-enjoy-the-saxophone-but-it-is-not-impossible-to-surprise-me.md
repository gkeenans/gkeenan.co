Hi, please listen to this:

Quick, I don’t think it’s legit, and it could disappear at any moment because _Square Enix for some reason doesn’t want to put it on any streaming service for me to listen to on repeat?_[^1] ***(Update—1/20/2025: The song referenced in this post is the "Partitio, The Merchant" theme, which is now available, along with the rest of the Octopath Traveler II soundtrack, on most major streaming services. This happened awhile ago, but I just came back now to update the page due to a reader pointing out the original embed was finally cast into Hell.)*** 

As Jason Schreier perfectly summed up in this [Tweet](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1625959722120581120):

> This track from Octopath Traveler II goes so hard it should be illegal

It’s true. It should be illegal, but it’s not, and that is good. Honestly, if you make it to the 2:05 mark and aren’t inspired to be a better person, I don’t know what to say to you. It is a song that builds perfectly to an epic climax that leaves you awestruck, breathless, desperate for more.

This is one of those songs that causes my body to gyrate uncontrollably. This is a song that would inspire great armies to throw down their arms and enjoy a fine beverage together, like a Squirt or a cream soda. This is a song that would bring Nostradamus to tears. On his knees, he would lament, “How could I have possibly seen such beauty—so elusive, so fleeting—in a world mired in dreariness, this shines through as a beacon. It is proof of the Lord almighty watching over us. Have mercy, O Lord, as I did not recognize my foibles. I misused this gift you bestowed upon me!”

It’s like, lol, Nostradamus, chill, bud. It’s not that deep.

Anyway, it’s a very good song that somehow manages to reach greatness despite its reliance on my all-time least favorite woodwind instrument: the saxophone.[^2]

Yeah, I’m brave enough to admit out loud that the saxophone is, sonically, the equivalent of two balloons rubbing together. It’s abrasive and grating. Many instruments hum, harmonious and pleasant, but that is something of which the saxophone is incapable. It cannot hum, it can only scream. It is an instrument that screams at you out of a dopey gullet.

Also, it’s not even wood. It’s brass. Why is it in the woodwind family? That doesn’t make any sense. But what do you call it? Brasswind? Ew, no. That evokes the vision of some monstrous amalgam of instrument families. Like the creature from _Splice._

The one with Adrien Brody.

[This one](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1017460/).

The saxophone is the horrifying byproduct of orchestral gene splicing, and, frankly, I don’t want to see Adrien Brody fuck it either.[^3]

Okay, yeah, this one has gone off the rails a little, but I’ve been sitting with these feelings for decades and I needed an outlet. To offset some of that bad karma, I will now recite off the top of my head my three favorite pieces of music that showcase the saxophone.

1. The song at the top of this post.
    
2. “[Number 9](https://song.link/us/i/659034927)” by Moon Hooch
    
3. … Uh… “Careless Whisper”?
    

Those are the rare few that are not only good in spite of the presence of saxophone, I would go so far as to say that they are good _because_ of the presence of saxophone.

Alright, post done.

**Do not contact me with your opinion about the saxophone. I will have you arrested.**


[^1]: JUST LET ME GIVE YOU MONEY, SQUARE ENIX.

[^2]: I do not mean any offense to any saxophonists out there, but please for the love of god pick a better instrument. I hear the cello rules. Maybe an oboe?

[^3]: I guess you’ll just have to watch the movie. It’s… fine.
