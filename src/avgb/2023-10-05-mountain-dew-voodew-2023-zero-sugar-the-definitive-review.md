**_Disclaimer: Before venturing further, please note that I truly, absolutely believe that the only good flavor of Mountain Dew is Baja Blast. I don’t think that taints my opinion on this particular product, but it’s worth it to keep in mind._**

Never before in my life have I ever tasted something and felt compelled to immediately rush to my lil’ internet blog and write about it.

As they say, it’s never too late to grow as a person.

Not two hours ago, I was wrapping up my weekly grocery run at the local Kroger. Whenever I grocery shop, I always venture into the chilled beverages section to purchase myself some sort of sweet, carbonated treat. A reimbursement for the mental anguish I endure for having to navigate the aisles of a suburban grocery store from behind a cart with at least two janky wheels, dodging my fellow humans, the vast majority of whom seem blissfully unaware of the existence of others. My soda reward is the only thing that keeps me sane.

Today, staring back at me from behind the glass doors, was Mountain Dew VooDEW[^1] Zero Sugar. The buzz surrounding this product has flitted about in my social group the past few weeks. Most of the discourse that I heard was about how elusive it was, especially the Zero Sugar variety, so much so that to happen upon a bottle of it in the wild almost felt like I had stumbled into Bigfoot while vacationing in Bielefeld. I admit, I was smitten by the mystery of it all.

As a professional who takes their job extremely seriously, I do think it’s important that I divulge my inherent bias against zero sugar beverages. They are, by and large, awful and far inferior to their non-zero sugar counterparts. There are a couple zero sugar sodas that I can tolerate, namely Coke Zero and end of list. All others, without fail, I generally despise.

But there were only two of these unicorns left, and the curiosity they instilled in me managed to overcome my apprehension about the cursed “Zero Sugar” label plastered at the bottom of the bottle. Like, come on, how bad could it be? Maybe it would surprise me.

It did. It did surprise me.

Surprised me with how _fucking bad it is_.

I have nothing kind to say about this abysmal drink. From the first sip I took when I sat down in the car, my body recoiled in disdain for what I had inflicted upon it. The first taste I experienced was the familiar, sickly chemical filth that is the calling card of the artificial sweetener. As if to prime your body that what’s about to enter it will be unpleasant, but it’s too late to turn back now. You fucked up. Only sadness awaits.

The second is the distinctively medicinal taste of Cherry Dimetapp, a flavor that traumatized me in childhood, and whose old scars have been reopened once again in my late 30s at the hands of PepsiCo, Inc.[^2]

There are no words to accurately convey how deeply unpleasant the experience of imbibing this swill was. I was so reviled by it that I took two sips and _threw away the bottle_. I did not even leave the parking lot. I took a sip. Gasped. Took another sip. Gagged. Looked to my left, saw a garbage can, and threw it the fuck out. I didn’t even dump it on the asphalt, because I felt _so much_ _empathy for the ground_ that I dare not assault it with this liquid.

I cannot remember the last time I discarded a drink out of sheer disgust[^3], but this was an overwhelming and unwelcome assault on my tastebuds. The entire 10 minute drive home, I was trying to rid myself of the taste to no avail. It coated my tongue. Even now, hours later, the memory lives on, and I worry that for the rest of my life I’ll experience flashbacks to the moment I defiled my mouth with VooDEWDEW.

Actually, a shit-flavored soda seems pretty on-brand for them at this point, so I demand royalties when they inevitably produce it and settle on that punny moniker.

In all seriousness, there are people in my real, _actual life_ who have _actually said_ that they _actually enjoy_ this flavor, and the only explanation that makes sense is that the Mountain Dew fanbase is fully Stockholm Syndromed and PepsiCo is exploiting that brainwashing for as long as they can, slowly but surely making worse and worse flavors of their undrinkable demon piss until they can get by on just packaging Zero Sugar Chemical Waste.

No reasonable person would willingly put this into their body repeatedly, and I truly believe we’re at the point where we have a moral imperative to stage interventions and ensure no one drinks this garbage ever again.

Shame on the folks at Mountain Dew. Shame on PepsiCo. Shame on Elon Musk, because this shit is so bad that he must be involved somewhere along the line. If there is any greater indication that we’re speeding head on into full societal collapse, I don’t know what it is.

Sound the alarms.

[^1]: Stylization theirs.

[^2]: Mountain Dew claims they collaborated with Cherry Airheads to concoct this flavor, and my response to that is that the people who makes Airheads punk’d you. That or they are war criminals who should be tried in The Hague for the development of chemical weapons.

[^3]: And I used to drink IPAs!
