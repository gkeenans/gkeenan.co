If you’ve read anything on this blog, you’ll see that I’ve referenced [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me) a [number](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/i-want-whatever-drugs-robb-knight-is-having-except-i-think-the-drug-is-sleep-deprivation) of [times](https://gkeenan.co/now). It’s actually getting out of hand.

In my defense, it’s only because he is not only extremely smart and attractive, but also because he has very good ideas. One of those very good ideas is [App Defaults](https://rknight.me/app-defaults/), in which he was inspired by a [podcast episode](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) (and [this post](https://gabz.blog/2023/11/03/my-defaults.html) by Gabz) to list all of the default applications he uses in his computing life.

As previously established, I am a highly impressionable person and also I am desperate for Robb’s validation,[^1] so here’s my own list.

**_Warning: Do not give me negative feedback on this list. I will print out your email and throw it in the garbage and then light it on fire._**

* * *

📨 Mail Client: I use Apple's **Mail.app** on both Mac and iOS. On PC, I just log into **iCloud**'s fucking website

📮 Mail Server: **iCloud**. I have a few **Gmail** addresses that are essentially artifacts of a simpler, shittier time where I thought Google was good

📝 Notes: I use Apple's **Notes.app** for most note-taking. If I have to collaborate, I'll cycle between things like [**Craft**](https://www.craft.do), [**Notion**](https://www.notion.so), or [**Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com)

✅ To-Do: Apple's **Reminders.app** (and previously [**Things 3**](https://culturedcode.com/things/))

📷 iPhone Photo Shooting: Apple's **Camera.app**, usually with ProRAW enabled.

🟦 Photo Management: Apple's **Photos.app**, with editing typically done in [**Darkroom**](https://darkroom.co)

📆 Calendar: [**Google Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r), which I do not really like, however anyone in my life I have to plan things with uses this fucking thing, so I feel stuck

📁 Cloud File Storage: **iCloud Drive** mostly. A lil' [**Dropbox**](https://www.dropbox.com) for VO work and podcast stuff

📖 RSS: **No.**[^2]

🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: You cannot convince me that anyone uses anything other than the Contacts app that comes built-in with their phone. Do not email me about this.

🌐 Browser: **Safari** on iOS and Mac. **Firefox** on PC.

💬 Chat: **iMessage** and [**Discord**](https://discord.com)

💁🏻‍♂️Social: [**Mastodon**](https://social.lol/@keenan) and [**Glass**](https://glass.photo/keenan)

🔖 Bookmarks: Whatever manager is in my browser.

📑 Read It Later: I use this thing called **_my brain_**, which has been historically unreliable, so I rarely read anything later.

📜 Word Processing: Ideally? [**Dropbox Paper**](https://paper.dropbox.com) or [**Craft**](https://www.craft.do). Realistically? [**Google Docs**](https://docs.google.com) or [**Pages**](https://www.apple.com/pages/). _\[Update—1/3/2024: I recently brought_ [**_iA Writer_**](https://ia.net/writer) _back into the fold, and it is what I plan to exclusively use to draft my extremely good and nice blog posts in the future. All is right in the world (aside from all of the shit, obviously, but do we even need that type of clarification anymore? Can we just collectively agree to assume that context matters and we don’t need to endlessly pick apart every innocuous statement anyone ever makes? Yes, there are a lot of shitheels in the world. By all means, make their lives miserable. But let’s just please stop spiraling down into a pedantry abyss every time we feel the slightest bit prickled.).\]_

📈 Spreadsheets: [**Numbers**](https://www.apple.com/numbers/) or [**Google Sheets**](https://sheets.google.com), depending on whether I need to collaborate or not

📊 Presentations: I am a slut for [**Keynote**](https://www.apple.com/keynote/), but I am also fond of [**iA Presenter**](https://ia.net/presenter)’s whole shtick

🛒 Shopping Lists: **Reminders.app** has gotten really good for this. I used to use [**Grocery**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grocery-smart-shopping-list/id1195676848), but I find it unnecessary now.

🍴 Meal Planning: [**Mela**](https://mela.recipes) on iPhone/iPad. It’s maybe my favorite app.

💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance: [**YNAB**](https://www.ynab.com)

📰 News: **Apple News**

🎵 Music: **Apple Music**

🎤 Podcasts: [**Castro**](https://castro.fm), but I’ve been considering moving over to Apple Podcasts _\[Update—11/30/2023: Due to circumstances_ [_no one in the world could have possibly seen coming_](https://www.macstories.net/news/popular-ios-podcast-player-castro-sold-to-tiny/)_, I mean, it is truly unbelievable that this happened and I am still absolutely reeling from the news,_ [_Castro is shutting down_](https://podnews.net/update/castro-to-close)_. As a result, I have made the move to Apple Podcasts.\]_

🔐 Password Management: [**1Password**](https://1password.com), like a sane person

🔉 Audio Editing: [**Logic Pro**](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) on Mac (or [**GarageBand**](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) if it’s a really light edit)

🎞️ Video Editing: [**Final Cut Pro**](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) on Mac, [**DaVinci Resolve**](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) on PC

### **The moral of the story**

Apple’s apps are _pretty dang good_ for everything I want to accomplish. I’m also a bit of a purist, so I tend to default to defaults, even if they aren’t quite as robust as other options. There was a time in my life when I was a bit more adventurous, but I largely cannot be bothered,[^3] and that has been further exacerbated by the fact that I don’t have a corporate job anymore, so most of the shit I’m doing is just for my personal life, and I don’t require much.

Also computers are boring now, but that’s a post for another day.[^4]

[^1]: Do you think he’ll see this? Hi, Robb!

[^2]: Okay, I guess [**Reeder**](https://reederapp.com), but I hardly use it. I’m just a weirdo who likes to go to people’s websites. Sue me.

[^3]: I am 37 and sad.

[^4]: I promise I’ll never write this.
