As someone who rarely dabbles in hyperbole, I experience zero hesitancy when I say that I think [Zach Gage](http://www.stfj.net) is a genius who is on track to save humanity using nothing but his unrivaled propensity for whimsy.

After a string of wildly imaginative, beautiful, and fun iOS games, all of which manage to expertly blend familiar mechanics with new, accessible twists, he’s now working on a new project called [Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com).[^1]

Puzzmo.

Puzzmo!

Puzzmo is a daily offering of puzzles that is as adorable as it is addictive. Some of them are old favorites. Some are new. I played my first round of Puzzmos today. The first thing I thought was, “Wow, this so fucking cute and fun I’m gonna write about it on my stupid blog.”

I’ve created a very simple rubric to help you understand if you will like Puzzmo:

1. Do you like puzzles?
    
2. Do you like the sound of the word Puzzmo when you say it out loud? Try it. Puzzmo. Say it three times. Call up a friend who you believe will answer their phone right now, and when they pick up, just whisper the word “Puzzmo” and hang up.
    

Did you answer “yes” to either of the above? Okay, you will like Puzzmo. Go sign up.[^2]


[^1]: A delicious mix of plosive and fricative that tickles the brain and delights the palate. How much more fun could a word be to say than Puzzmo? Could the puzzles Puzzmo presents possibly provide pleasure parity on par with pronouncing Puzzmo? Perhaps.

[^2]: It’s invite-only at the moment, so trying to get in is like a puzzle in and of itself. How meta!
