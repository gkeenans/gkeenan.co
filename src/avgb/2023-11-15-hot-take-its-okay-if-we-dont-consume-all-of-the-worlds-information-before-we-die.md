One of the more distressing qualities of humanity, in my mind, is the emphasis we collectively put on “efficiency.”[^1] It saturates our professional existence. It haunts our socioeconomic barometer. And it drives our current approach to both creating and appreciating art. It’s insidious, the inordinate amount of power “efficiency” holds over our daily lives, without even drawing much attention to itself, creeping up in unanticipated ways: the life hacks bombarding us on TikTok; the large language models we use to reduce the amount of effort we need to put into writing an email to our colleague; the Trim Silence feature on our podcast player of choice.

_What?_

The Trim Silence feature on our podcast player of choice.

_I don’t foll-_

This post is about how much I hate the Trim Silence feature.[^2]

I will admit that this is perhaps a weird hill to die on, but I truly believe that Trim Silence is an abomination that should be fully eradicated from existence, as it not only spits in the face of the people who take the time and effort to produce their shows, but also, more broadly, encourages a way of interfacing with art that can only be described as gluttonous.

For the uninitiated, Trim Silence is a feature in many podcast apps that seeks to eliminate any pause in conversation—however brief, however intentional—so as to expedite the listening process and ensure efficiency is always the priority. Oftentimes, this is accomplished by dynamically adjusting the playback speed of the audio, increasing the speed when there is silence, and then reverting to “normal speed” when speaking is detected. The result being a nearly uninterrupted stream of information, and an average time savings of 5 minutes and 37 seconds added to our lives. Pesky nuances, such as comedic timing or a brief pause after a thoughtful question or an opportunity to process the knowledge of the devastating horrors the average soldier in World War I experienced,[^3] need not pester us. Our time is too valuable, and the information we ingest can’t fill our gullets fast enough. Why process when you can just keep listening?

I think about this a lot.

Full disclosure: I used to be a Trim Silence advocate! When Overcast launched in 2014, one of the marquee features was Smart Speed (Overcast’s name for Trim Silence) and I was initially a Smart Speed enjoyer. It was the only way I listened to all podcasts.

Until the moment I listened to one of my own shows.

I remember thinking, “Did I fuck up the editing?" Something seemed off. The banter was too quick to hop between me and my cohost. There was this uncanny valley effect as one of us would speak and the playback speed normalized—the beginning of sentences were slightly too fast, too clipped. I could tell it was me talking, but it still didn’t. quite. sound. like. me. It was juuust weird enough to ring untrue, like I couldn’t trust it. Smart Speed altered the audio to the point where the creative choices I had made during recording and editing were unrecognizable. The intent of the work had been subverted by an algorithm. That was the moment I swore off Smart Speed and decided I would never use a comparable feature ever again.

Sure, with time, software could improve to better clip the silence and leave the voices properly intact, but that is only useful if you assume that all silence is bad in the first place. So much communication happens in the gaps between the sound we produce. Moments made funnier, more thoughtful, more heartbreaking by recognizing that a well-placed pause says so much more than any word uttered in its stead. Silence gives sound a chance to flourish. Let it.

Or is it more important to just complete the task? Consume the show. Gobble it up. Glean whatever little meaning you can and move on to the next thing. Clear the backlog. The new season of Stranger Things is on. Binge it in a day so you don’t get left behind. Forget it a week later. The new Taylor Swift just dropped. Listen to it until the new Beyoncé. Listen to that until the new Kendrick. Listen to that until the new… Fleet Foxes? I dunno. Listen to this audiobook at 2x. Watch this LinkedIn Learning video. Queue up that thing on YouTube. What’s happening on Twitter? Scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll scroll.[^4] Look at this Reddit post. Read what’s on Apple News. Check your RSS feeds. Watch that new show on Netflix. Watch that new show on Hulu. Watch that new show on Peacock. Watch that new show on Max. Watch that new show on Paramount+. Watch that new show on Disney+. Watch that new show on Apple TV+. Watch that new show on Roku (lol). Wait what’s that actor’s name? Yeah, they were in that thing. No, no, the other thing. We just watched it. Yeah, we did. Yes, I swear you and I watched that. Yes, you have, you said you liked it, I remember. Anyway, can you believe what they said about Israel and Palestine? You need this promotion. You need more money. You need to upskill. You need a better manager. You need to network. You need to market yourself. You need to monetize your hobbies. You need to sell your art. You need to hustle. You need to count calories. You need to check out this story on Insta. You need to hook them in the first five seconds before they scroll past. No one wants to put in the time to listen to someone who can’t capture their attention. Trick them. Make them mad. Get them hooked. Make them crave more. Here’s another fucking Star Wars movie. Here’s why it’s fucking terrible. Here’s why it’s the best fucking thing Disney has ever done since it invented Star Wars. Here’s the first in an anthology series you’ll watch over the course of 20 fucking years. Don’t miss it. Oh, you didn’t watch Ms. Marvel?

Help, please, I am drowning and there’s only so much time left before I am completely forgotten, and I haven’t been able to do anything I thought I was supposed to do, and all I want is for people to see me and appreciate me, and I just want to make things that say something meaningful to someone, anyone. Are you reading this? I want to be done with this blog post, but I am so worried that if I stop, it won’t mean a single goddamned thing, I won’t mean anything. I am no one. I am nothing. I am so excited for the new Call of Duty. I played 2,000 hours of Diablo IV, and here’s why it’s total garbage. The new Zelda is literally the best game ever created. There is nothing more bae than swag, no cap. You will never believe how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.

(Breathe.)

There is no point in time where we have had more access to information than we do now. You could cut out every single possible nanosecond of silence and never make it through. You will never be efficient enough to see it all before you’re gone.

(Breathe.)

And that’s okay. Maybe it’s better if you just sit and listen and enjoy the art. Someone worked hard to create it. It deserves your full attention.

(Breathe.)

When was the last time you truly, deeply, unabashedly connected with something and you didn’t say a single word about it?

(Breathe.)

What is the most important thing to you?

(Breathe.)

Why?

(Breathe.)

Why?

(Breathe.)

Why?

[^1]: “Um, Keenan, are you ignoring genocide?” I hear you asking, to which my answer is, “What about you shut the fuck up and assume that we _both_ understand that the existence of a truly terrible thing doesn’t negate the existence of other, less-terrible things, and it’s actually alright for people to remark on the less-terrible thing without trying to ‘um, actually’ them into oblivion because they didn’t go out of their way to preempt their perspectives on the less-terrible thing by caveating in perpetuity until all communication loses meaning?” (See also: when someone says they’re depressed, it’s maybe not the best approach to say, “You have it way better than a lot of people.” Yeah, like, no fucking shit, but it’s still okay for me to be sad.) Anyway, stay tuned for my next blog post: “Hot Take: Genocide is bad.”

[^2]: And by extension: any feature that speeds up the audio or video we consume.
