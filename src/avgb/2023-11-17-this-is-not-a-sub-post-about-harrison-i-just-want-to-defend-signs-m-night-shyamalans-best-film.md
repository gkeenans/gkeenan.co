**_Disclaimer: I suppose it needs to be said that this piece contains some_** **_spoilers_** **_for_ Prometheus (2012) _and_ Signs (2002)_. Also if you’re really picky, some very minor spoilers for_ The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) _and_ Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker (2019). _So, uh, yeah, like, self-regulate however you need to._**

* * *

_Someone_[^1] in Discord was watching _Prometheus_, Ridley Scott’s 2012 _Alien_ (don’t call it a) prequel. And, as it is wont to do when somebody watches _Prometheus_, the discussion turned to “the moment.” You know “the moment,” the one that everyone (maybe even you) brings up to point out how “bad” and “lazy” and “illogical” the writing in _Prometheus_ is. “The moment” where the “super smart scientists,” in the midst of exploring an alien craft on an alien planet, find themselves face-to-face with a tiny, slithering alien creature—first contact—and their reaction is not overt fear, but fascination. Curiosity. Playfulness, even. Apprehension, sure. Caution, yeah. It is a slimy little alien reptile after all. But there’s a full range of emotion happening. Multiple reactions in quick succession. Confusion. Excitement! One of the scientists, after taking a hit off of his _space bong_, is feelin’ a _little paranoid_. The other is like, “Bro, shh, I got this,”[^2] and reaches out a hand to coax the creature, like one might when faced with a stray dog.

“She’s beautiful,”[^3] he says, reaching closer.

And we, as viewers of a horror thriller genre film, with all of the broader context and media literacy and safety of sitting in a room passively watching this event transpire, are collectively thinking:

_No! What? Why?! Why would you do this? You were just freaking out about being stranded on this ship a moment ago. Aren’t you scientists? You’re supposed to be intelligent! Why are you approaching an alien creature? Don’t! Stop! Stop trying to touch it! No! NO! Yep, duh, of course that was going to happen, yeah, yep, of course it’s wrapped around your arm now, yeah, he’s not gonna be able to cut it—oh fuck it just broke his arm—don’t cut it, it’s gonna have acid—yeah, acid for blood, yep, told you—oh fuck the acid just melted the spacemask onto his face[^4]—of course the alien is in his suit now. No way it’s gonna go in his mou—yeah, okay, right in the mouth._

Clearly, had these two dumb-dumbs been written like the “super smart scientists” they were purported to be, that scene would’ve played out way differently.

But—now hear me out—what if sometimes people just, like, act illogically in the moment due to myriad factors in and out of their control? Consider for a second the fact that we’re kinda just little idiot animals and our lizard brains often take over when presented with extraordinary circumstances.

The one scientist says it himself: “She’s beautiful.” As he stares at a _literal alien_, something never witnessed before by humankind.

Is there a world where a scientist can be smart, but also susceptible—even overwhelmed—by curiosity? That it’s possible that even a very intelligent person, when presented with something completely novel (like, again, a _literal_ _alien_) could cause them to make what an outside observer might describe as an ill-advised decision?

Sometimes people just _do things_ and it’s not driven by logic or reason.[^5]

Have you ever slowed down to stare at a car crash on the other side of the highway? Okay, well, there’s literally nothing you can do about it. Logically, you know this. But now you’re causing traffic and potentially increasing the likelihood of additional collisions occurring because you’re not paying full attention to the road.

(And you can rest assured that the person behind you is likely incensed by the fact that you’re slowing down to gawk in the first place. “This fucking dumbass doesn’t know how to drive. Don’t slow down! Are you fucking stupid?? Honk honk.”)

It’s a weird thing that happens when we watch a movie, or read a book. We start to min-max character decisions. We take _our_ life experiences, _our_ insight into various other stories where we’ve seen similar events play out, _our_ assumptions at how someone should behave in any particular situation. And we often attribute the actions that we disagree with to “the writing.” _The writing is bad. Why didn’t the director consider these plot holes? Why would this character do X when doing Y would have circumvented everything?_

We forget that a character choosing to do X instead of Y is why the story happens.

So many grievances with the stories we tell each other could be resolved if we just remembered that _sometimes, what happens is what happens._

_Why would she run upstairs if there’s a killer in the house?_

Because she was being chased by a killer and made a bad decision in the moment because being chased by a killer is probably a little stressful.

_The entire conflict of the story would’ve been solved if they had just talked to each other from the beginning!_

Yeah, and it’s not an uncommon occurrence that people lack the emotional intelligence or self-awareness to have a conversation like adults.

_Why didn’t they just fly an Eagle to Mount Doom?_

Because they fucking didn’t.[^6]

_Why would the aliens try to invade Earth if the most abundant substance on the planet was fatal to them?_

Okay, yeah, let’s talk about _Signs_ for a second, because I unabashedly love this movie, and I find the little nitpicky nonsense people come up with to be so asinine.

Here are the actual facts that we know about the aliens in _Signs_:

1. They are here.
    
2. They do not mix well with water (and also, judging by their actions, they seem to know that).
    

Here are the facts we **do not** know about the aliens in _Signs:_

1. Why are they invading Earth?
    
2. How intelligent are they?
    
3. What type of sensors do they have?
    
4. What is their biological makeup?
    
5. How many are there?
    
6. What planet are they from?
    
7. What are they doing with the people they abduct?
    

I’m stopping there because that list is, for all intents and purposes, limitless. The point being that the film _Signs_ quite deliberately does not provide answers to questions about the aliens, because the aliens are not what the movie is about. The movie is about what happens when a person who has lost all faith is confronted with a completely surreal challenge that leads him back to the path from which he strayed. “Why are the aliens here?” isn’t important. What’s important is the fact that _they are here_ and now the main characters need to deal with it, and _what will they learn about themselves in the process?_

There’s a lot going on in _Signs_ that is far more interesting and important than the existence of aliens. Look, I know I just went on a whole diatribe about how when presented with _literal aliens_, that people should be forgiven for letting their curiosity about said aliens take over, but also shut up and believe me when I say that the aliens in _Signs_, while creating some very spooky and exciting moments in the story, are not the main attraction. Instead, there’s an entire philosophical meditation on grief, and fate, and identity, and faith, and family, and realizing what is actually important to you and what you’re willing to do to ensure you stay alive long enough to embrace it.

The details about the aliens aren’t necessary to the story. Personally, I think _Signs_ is more exciting and sinister because of all the mystery about them. Like, consider for a second how interesting it is that they’re here, they seem to know that water is bad for them, _and yet_ they are still motivated enough to continue on with their invasion. Is it desperation? Is it hubris? What circumstances drove them to make this decision? We don’t know. We’ll never know.

And that’s where art gets to be a conversation between the artist and viewer. When we bring our own experiences, ideas, assumptions, and interpretations, we get to participate in the larger conversation about the world that’s been created. We get to add on to it in our minds. We get to draw meaning from what’s said and what isn’t.

However, all too often, our assumptions lead the conversation away from curiosity and toward endless nitpicking. It does feel worse now than at any point I can remember, though that may just be my recency bias showing. Perhaps I’m just _too online_. But it does seem as though we’ve collectively moved more and more toward artistic literalism, where anything not explicitly stated in the text by the author means that there was an oversight, rather than a choice. We’re quick to dismiss a character’s decision that we disagree with as merely “bad writing,” or an unanswered question as a “plot hole.” To me, that’s more often about our own unwillingness to do our part in engaging with the story, than a problem with the story itself.[^7]

I want to be clear that I know that bad writing exists. I saw _The Rise of Skywalker_, and you’ll never convince me that Chewbacca receiving the medal from Maz Kanata makes any sense in the context of the story. It’s just fan service that exists solely to appease the meta conversation, and fan service in place of story is hacky bullshit.

But I know that the broader mindset shift I’ve described has helped me enjoy stories more. I mean, I went from someone who scoffed at the existence of _Prometheus_ when I saw it in the theater, to someone who is writing a blog post defending it. Upon rewatching it years after its release, through this new lens, I was excited to see that it’s actually a pretty excellent movie.

It’s best to remember that sometimes things just happen, and the important thing is what happens next.[^8]


[^1]: Not naming names, but let’s call him… Uh… Shmarrison.

[^2]: Not actual dialogue.

[^3]: Actual dialogue.

[^4]: God, this scene is fucking cool. Holy shit, even 11 years later it still looks great.

[^5]: Like, Christ, just look at my first marriage.

[^6]: There is an actual answer to this question and you can do your own research into it, but it doesn’t change the fact that due to a number of factors not important to the actual story, they fucking didn’t.

[^7]: Or, look, maybe you just didn’t like it, and that’s okay, too.

[^8]: One of my favorite anecdotes about Tolkien writing _The Lord of the Rings_ was how Faramir emerging from the bushes in _The Two Towers_ surprised him. Tolkien remarked that he didn’t know Faramir was there until he revealed himself. One of our most acclaimed authors writing one of our most acclaimed stories, surprised by the sudden existence of his own character. As a writer, I know that sometimes our characters do things that we don’t expect. We’re not writing what they do. We’re writing about what they do.
