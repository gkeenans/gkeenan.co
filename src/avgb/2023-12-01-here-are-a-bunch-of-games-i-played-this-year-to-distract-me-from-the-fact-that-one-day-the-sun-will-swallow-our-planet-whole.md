It’s December. Yeah. Like. _Fuuuck_. Right? Time just passing us by as we collectively inch ever closer to a distinct and (from my understanding) quite permanent dearth of consciousness.[^1]

Anyway, here is a selection of games I played this year that helped stave off the existential dread. My criteria for selecting these is as follows:

1. I like them.
    

They are otherwise unranked. I do not like ranking things. These are just good games that I enjoyed to varying degrees for varying reasons.

Back in January, I started playing a game that I have since put like 900 literal hours into, and I still play it basically every day. This is, to be charitable, _highly unusual_ for me. Some people don’t bat an eye at investing thousands of hours into a game. Me? I like variety. It’s rare that I dump more than a hundred hours into any one experience. Exceedingly rare that I near a thousand. Anyway, that game is called [_Escape From Tarkov_](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com) and I don’t even know why I’m recommending it because I think the vast majority of people who read this will probably think I am losing my goddamned mind for enjoying it in the first place. That’s fine, I know this one is _niche_, but one of you is gonna look into this and be like, “Yeah, this is exactly my shit.” You and me, we are the same.

On the other hand, if you investigated _Escape From Tarkov_ and your immediate reaction was to do a 180 and run through a brick wall, might I suggest [_Jusant_](https://dont-nod.com/en/games/jusant/)?

_Jusant_ is a wonderful, solemn, heartwarming, heartwrenching, cute, bleak, optimistic, and beautiful meditative journey where you traverse a large rock pillar using very simple-and-forgiving-yet-immersive climbing mechanics. Along the way, you learn about the people who lived here before you as they faced an existential crisis, and how they responded. It’s one of the rare games that got me to care about its narrative, so much so that I played through its 5-ish hour adventure multiple times so I could lap up as much detail as possible. As of this writing, it’s available on Game Pass, though I do truly believe it’s worth every penny if you decide to purchase it on the platform of your choice.

It’s at this point in the writing process that I look at my list and think to myself, “Yo, there’s no fucking way I’m going to write a paragraph for each of these,” so I’m just gonna do a quick little lightning round:

- [_Baldur’s Gate 3_](https://baldursgate3.game) — An absolutely wild and sprawling RPG adventure that miraculously recreates a large part of the D&D experience, for better and for worse.
    
- [_Diablo IV_](https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/) — The opposite of Baldur’s Gate 3, but when you click on stuff it explodes lmfao it’s v fun, fam, pew pew pew.
    
- [_Starfield_](https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield) — Yes, I liked Starfield and I don’t care what anyone says about it.[^2]
    
- [_Forza Motorsport_](https://forza.net) — Yes, I liked Forza Motorsport, and I think everyone (especially the people on the subreddit) needs to lighten the fuck up.
    
- [_The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_](https://zelda.nintendo.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/) — Just a remarkable little indie gem from a small studio that manages to capture the magic of video games in a way that most other games only dream of.
    
- [_Remnant 2_](https://www.remnantgame.com/en/) — Some people describe this as “Dark Souls with guns” but I like to think of it as “shooty bang bang gun/sword smacky whackathon that is sometimes challenging.” It’s quite good, and also it just surprise dropped on Game Pass.
    
- [_Alan Wake 2_](https://www.alanwake.com) — Fuckin’ weird.
    
- [_Cocoon_](https://www.cocoongame.com) — Fuckin’ cool.
    
- [_Star Wars: Jedi Survivor_](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor) — Fuckin’ Star Wars.
    
- [_Spider-Man 2_](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-spider-man-2/) — Fuckin’ Spider-Man.
    
- [_Laya’s Horizon_](https://layashorizon.com) — Ever play Alto’s Adventure/Odyssey on iOS? Well this is the same studio, so imagine those games but in 3D and instead of a snowboard you have a wingsuit. It’s a Netflix game, so that blows, but I think it’s worth a look.
    
- [_Meet Your Maker_](https://meetyourmakergame.com) — It’s like Doom had a little video game baby with Lego. Bonus points to this game for getting me to interface with the level builder, something I almost never do in games, but was especially addictive and fun in this.
