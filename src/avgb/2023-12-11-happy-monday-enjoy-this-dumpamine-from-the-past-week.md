Hi. I saw [this post](https://frenetic.ink/2023/12/11/week-notes-no.html). I’ve seen [others like it](https://mikehayn.es/post/4481/), but this one hit at the right place. The right time. The moment where I was finishing up my cold brew (I’ve started making my own, and the coffee I got from [Sightglass](https://sightglasscoffee.com) this month _fuckin’ ruuuuules_) and eating some [Brunsviger](https://sundaybaker.co/brunsviger-danish-coffee-cake/) my wife made. The right Monday late-morning/early-afternoon time where I was like, “Hell yeah, time to make up a stupid word and tell people about some cool shit I did/saw/thought/was subjected to last week.”

### Astronaut time

Are you familiar with the concept of **Astronaut Time**? Neither was I, but my wife brought it up to me after seeing someone talk about it on TikTok. She brought it up mostly because she recognized that she has the habit of strolling into my office throughout the day to say hello. To be clear, I do not mind this. My wife is literally my favorite person, and being in the same room as her is one of life’s great joys.

Anyway, Astronaut Time. It’s a system, I suppose, an _agreement_ between two or more people to easily inform the other(s) of when you anticipate being _in the zone_ (like I am right now, I’m in Astronaut Time) and just need minimal distractions. Particularly helpful if you and the people you live with work from home (but I would have paid a bajillion-hojillion actual money dollars for something similar when I worked in an office). I believe the TikTok couple had some sort of whiteboard that they would update with a smiley-face next to their name when it was Astronaut Time? I dunno, I didn’t watch it.

The solution my wife and I decided to try was setting up automations on our phones. We created a Focus in iOS called “Astronaut Time” that would automatically send an iMessage to the other person when it’s enabled/disabled.

Will it work? Who knows! It’s fun to try. Today is the first day since we talked about it that I’ve actually turned on the Focus Mode.

### The new piece

Last week, I started a new piece that I expected would be a bit bigger than usual, but wasn’t expecting it to be quite as big as it is shaping up to be. That’s super vague! Regardless, it’s been a long time since I worked for days on a single piece of writing. I usually abandon something if I can’t finish it in a day because I am _super impatient_ and what some people might call a “bad writer,” and someone who is “not satisfied with the concept of delayed gratification,” and maybe “that’s why I’ll never find true happiness.”

Anyway, the best thing I can say about the new piece is that it’s not about tech! Instead, it’s an introspective look at traumatic experiences and how it can take a long time and a lot of big changes to start healing. Hilarious stuff!

My goal is to finish it this week. I ran into a snag where Squarespace ate a large portion of the draft, so I had to rewrite a significant chunk of it. Which brings me to my next thing.

### iA Writer

Wow, it’s good to be back. I used to be an [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) zealot back in the day, when I worked mostly on Mac and iOS, but when I took up blogging once again, I found that I wanted to write at my desk, where my PC is, so I decided I was gonna be a lazy garbage person and just use Squarespace’s editor. FOOL ME ONCE, SQUARESPACE. Fool me once.[^1]

This is probably not news to many of you, but it turns out that iA Writer is _also_ on Windows, which makes life so much easier.

### Past Lives

The second I saw the trailer for [_Past Lives_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA244xewjcI), I knew that it was going to be _Very Much My Shit™_, which is why it is weird that it took me so long to finally watch it, but I finally watched it, and hooooo boy, was I right. It’s right up there with _Oppenheimer_ as one of my favorite films released this year. Beautifully shot and directed. Absolutely wonderful performances[^2] that manage to say more with silence than they do with words, which felt particularly pertinent because [reasons](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/hot-take-its-okay-if-we-dont-consume-all-of-the-worlds-information-before-we-die).

This movie made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me cry more. It made me look at my own life through a new lens. It made me love and appreciate my wife even more than I already did.

Fuck. Wow. What a film.

### Three games

Turns out _Lethal Company_ is a [great and silly time](https://youtu.be/ueE_Aa-93T8?si=Ou7CvuLNyfc5I5XA).

[_The Finals_](https://www.reachthefinals.com) surprise launched during the Game Awards. It’s chaotic, infuriating, and awesome.

I stumbled upon [Songs of Syx](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162750/Songs_of_Syx/), and was intrigued to see that it was a city-builder that seems to combine the approachability (lol) of [_RimWorld_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/) with the scope of [_Dwarf Fortress_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/). The demo available on Steam is an **unlimited, full-version** of a previous build of the game, which is just absolutely wild to me. I played the demo for 30 minutes. Felt lost. Turned it off. Read some Steam reviews. Turned it back on. Played the tutorial again. Felt lost. Turned it off. Read some discussions on Steam. Turned it back on. Played for a couple hours. It clicked. Game is _dense, but gooood._

### TikTok Gave Me Autism: The Politics of Self Diagnosis

The very funny title of a [video essay](https://youtu.be/x4ieMzbXiRA?si=2iTG_Y8lSytZtk1T) that was not only humorous, but extremely thoughtful and informative. This helped shift my perspective on a number of things, including MY OWN SENSE OF SELF.

### **My favorite song that came on shuffle while I wrote this post**

“Do Ya Wanna Taste It” by Wig Wam, the song that plays during the [opening credits sequence of _Peacemaker_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mrr3UNALww), which I love.

Very, very, very close last-second runner-up: “[Birthday Cake](https://song.link/us/i/207956093)” by Cibo Matto.
