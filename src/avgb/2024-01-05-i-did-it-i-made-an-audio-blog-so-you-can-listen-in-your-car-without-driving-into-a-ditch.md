Hi. You know, I’ve had literally twos of people ask me, “Hey, Keenan! I want to subscribe to your audio blog in my podcast player of choice!” Cool! A few things…

First: not a question.

Second: thank you. Feedback received.

Third: I did it. You’re welcome.

[A Very Good (Audio) Blog](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-very-good-audio-blog/id1724269695) is now a thing. It’s on Apple Podcasts, which means it should be in the process of percolating outward into your Overcasts and your Pocket Casts and your Castro—wait, nope, lol—your… what other podcast apps are out there now? I’m not on the up and up.

Pick one, it’s probably there.

Except Spotify.

Anyway, I’ll still publish the audio on the corresponding blog posts themselves, in case people want to listen along in their browser as they read. Otherwise, think of these episodes as companions to the written piece. They’ll be missing things like footnotes, but should otherwise remain intact, with the added benefit of hearing my voice read them. Wow! What a day. Truly glorious. Happy 2024, everyone. I hope I don’t get bored and abandon this project in a week hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha[^1]

[^2]: It’s funny because of how I am.
