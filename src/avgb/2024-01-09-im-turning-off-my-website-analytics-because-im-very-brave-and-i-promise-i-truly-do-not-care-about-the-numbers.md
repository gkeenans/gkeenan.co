*Update — 07.01.2024: Contradicting everything I wrote in the post below back in January, I've decided to try an experiment with **Simple Analytics**, a cookieless and privacy-focused analytics platform. I've also decided to make the site's analytics [public](https://dashboard.simpleanalytics.com/gkeenan.co). Additionally, I have a [referral link](https://www.simpleanalytics.com/?referral=faqus), should you want to sign up and give me a little kickback for any paid subscription. I'll leave that referral link up for as long as I'm using this platform, but no longer.*

*Why did I do this? I think it's fair to question my resolve, considering how adamant I was in the original post. I do firmly believe that I am not as beholden to the sheer number of visitors as I once was. But, truth be told, the analytics were often a lovely source of discovery for me. I've found a number of wonderful websites that I otherwise might not have seen had they not sent someone my way. I have not yet run into the issue Rach Smith describes in [her post](https://rachsmith.com/i-turned-off-analytics/). If and when these stats start to feel like noise again, I'll drop them.*

*Anyway, I have left the original post unchanged below. Feel free to shake your head in disappoint as you witness my folly, my sheer hypocrisy, my inherent weakness as a human being, playing out in real-time—real-time, like how you can view my analytics on the public dashboard I linked above!*

<hr>

I find myself idly thumbing at my phone, swiping down, watching the little spinner do its thing, hoping a number goes up once the screen refreshes.

Why do I do this to myself?

In a previous life, I was a tech blogger, and the analytics killed me. The more time I spent obsessing, the less I wrote. The steeper the cliff in the line graph, the worse I felt. I wrote crap to fill an imaginary quota. I posted links to things I didn't actually care about. I antagonized obnoxious tech people whose personas I felt were rooted in being annoying for the sake of being annoying (read: my version of John Gruber's _Jackass of the Week_. Turns out the real jackass was the me I made along the way). I defended the richest company in the world because I used to work for them and thought that my unique perspective mattered, but in the end I was _defending the richest company in the world_ and holy shit, that was unnecessary. It sucked. It sucked so hard and also it was stupid. Eventually I stopped writing altogether because everything felt so pointless. Data burnout. Passion turned pittance.

When I started writing again recently, my wife noticed that I was digging into my site's analytics. There I was, secreted away on one side of the couch, looking at the Squarespace app. Again.

"I know you've said that it's been a problem for you in the past," she said. "Do you think you're obsessing again?"

"No," I said. And believed. I still believe it. I do. Promise. "I mostly just like to see where people are coming from." What little information I get about where in the world people are or, more interestingly, what website brought you here. What was the thought process? What was enticing? Why my site? Who sent you? I want to see their site.

Little mysteries to solve. Little sources of inspiration. Little compliments in the form of links.

But, let's be honest: it's mostly noise. The data sucks and also the data _sucks_. It sucks because it's basic and trivial and mostly just "a person went to this page and they stayed for a moment," and it _sucks_ because it's a distraction. As much as I want to create a story and develop a better understanding and make a connection, I'm not going to find that in an IP address no matter how hard I try. Cosplaying internet detective doesn't do much to sate my curiosity, it just lets me spin my wheels and trick me into thinking I'm being productive.

So I'm just gonna turn them off. For my peace of mind, and hopefully for yours. When it comes down to it, I don't _care_ about the data, and I don't do anything with it aside from wonder. I'm not going to change my writing to try and drive traffic, and I'm not going to start optimizing my site's layout to minimize bounce rate. Wanna bounce? Bounce. Fuck it. Life's too short to not bounce.

Of course, there will always be the curiosity. The longing for connection. The desire to know more about who is here and what they're all about. But honestly, it'd probably mean more to receive an [email](mailto:keenan@gkeenan.co) or a [Toot](https://social.lol/@keenan) if you feel so compelled.
