I want to see your art.

I want more of you in the world.

I want your creativity on full display in a way that portrays even a sliver of your wild, dynamic, incredible being.

Okay, it's not all about me, though, is it? I get that. Vulnerability and motivation and self-esteem and validation and cost and fear and anxiety and dread and blocks and the question of: "Is it enough? Am I enough? Will people like this? Will people like me? Will this mean anything? Who cares? Who cares? Who cares?"

I care.

What does it look like to put yourself on a page, or in a photo, or a brushstroke, or a string plucked and reverberating harmoniously out into the room? When does the screaming inside become loud enough, so all-encompassing that you open up the door to let it pour out of you?

Creativity is how we make sense of the world around us. We only have one you and one chance to know the world you know.

Is this getting a little too "live, laugh, love"? Fuck it. Embrace the cringe. Stop blowing out your own candle. You know whose opinion about your art is more important than just making it?

Fucking no one's.
