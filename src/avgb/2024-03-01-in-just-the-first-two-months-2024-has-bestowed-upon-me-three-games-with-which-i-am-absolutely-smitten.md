Will I ever tire of video games? It's a question I ask myself frequently, and, at times, even consider with any degree of sincerity. The reality is that even though I began playing these fucking things before I could properly regulate my bodily functions,[^1] this is a medium that continues to surprise, delight, and surprise and delight all over again. Even during periods where I feel like I've seen it all, experienced the last good ideas developers have to give us, there is, inevitably, a jolt to the system. A cascade of delicious interactive entertainment served up as a reminder that there is still a bit of joy in this world. However small. However fleeting. Despite my evolution into someone who has a truly difficult time looking past how _mechanical_ games truly are, compared to the wondrous, exciting, immersive experiences that consumed my youthful imagination.

Anyway, I'm just happy to declare that 2024 is yet another banger year for video games, and it's _barely March_. In a bizarro world where I gave a shit about ranking things, I would already have been presented with three—THREE!—games whose placement on a Game of the Year list would cause me great internal strife. What's _extremely cool_ to me is that two of those three games were not even remotely on my radar prior to their release! They just... _showed up,_ ready to fuck, like the rando at the orgy who actually turned out to be a very gracious and attentive lover. The first time he sauntered up behind you, delicate fingertips at your hips, lips surrounded by stubble at your ear, a quiet whisper, "Well hello." Electricity shooting up and down your spine. Every hair on your body standing on end. The delicate flutter of butterflies in your belly.

Who _was_ this person?

His name was Todd, and though your initial eye contact was brief, the spark of attraction between the two of you was undeniable and swift. Todd uncovered a deep sexual and spiritual awakening within you. A yearning to be seen, felt, loved, experienced. It's as though your bodies spoke to each other in a secret language—you couldn't understand a single word, but you still knew exactly what they were saying.

Over the years, Todd and you only ever grew closer. What began as a series of trysts blossomed into a toothbrush holder. A single drawer of the dresser. An entire side of the walk-in closet. A home you shared together. Todd's parents were wealthy, and, yes, he did benefit from a trust, but he never held that over your head. When you worked together, kneeling side by side in the garden out back, as the first buds on the trees began to wake up from a long, wintry slumber, you would think, "How did I get so lucky?" And he would look to you and smile—god, that smile! A smile to reassure you that no matter how hard things got in life, there was always solace in your love.

Years later, as Todd reached out for your hand to give it one last squeeze, you confessed, "I don't think I'm ready."

He mustered up the energy to smile. "Don't be sad," he said. "We got to have this."

And, as quickly as he entered your life, he left it. The house never felt quite the same, but the memory of Todd made you feel at home.

### **Helldivers 2**

I don't think it can be overstated just how fucking cool _Helldivers 2_ is. I am, admittedly, not a huge fan of the horde shooter genre—I played too much _Left 4 Dead_ and _Left 4 Dead 2_ years ago that I fear I burned myself out on any future iteration of this type of game. The one exception up until this point being _Deep Rock Galactic,_ but I think mostly because _Deep Rock Galactic_ feels like more of an exploration game, with moments of shooting at waves of enemies to break up the long stretches of just _vibing out_ while smacking your pickaxe against minerals.

Goddamn, _Deep Rock Galactic_ is so cool.

So I guess it's no surprise that one of the reasons is enjoy _Helldivers 2_ so much is that there is a _lot_ of _Deep Rock Galactic_ DNA in there. What it lacks in mining, it makes up for in chunky-ass guns that feel great to shoot, and explosions that fill your screen with intoxicating eye candy. It is a serotonin simulator, a dopamine drip plugged right into the back of your head. The developer, Arrowhead Game Studios, managed to distill the essence of this game down into a chaotic, absurdly fun third-person shooter that becomes exponentially fun_ner_ the more people you add to your squad. I truly cannot remember the last time I played a game with friends where we laughed more and had more intense, absurd moments that kept us clamoring for another round.

There is a reason this one is popping off right now. It is one of those rare games that manages to stay laser-focused on its commitment to showing players a good time. I can't believe in one week, we saw the release of perhaps the worst example of Live Service bullshit in _Suicide Squad_, only to have _Helldivers 2_ come out and show us perhaps the best. I was not expecting this to hit as hard as it does, and the more I play it, the more I want to play it.

### Last Epoch

Let's be clear, I am a casual enjoyer of the ARPG genre. I played a little _Diablo_ and _Diablo II_ back in the day, but the series never really clicked with me until _Diablo III_, and, yeah, I'm not afraid to admit that I really enjoyed _Diablo IV_ at launch. I've put hundreds of hours into those latter two titles, and have always felt pretty satisfied with the experience they gave me. They convinced me for awhile that I probably didn't need to look for much more elsewhere. Sure, I dipped my little toesies into _Path of Exile_ briefly after _Diablo IV_ began to feel stale, which happened far sooner than expected, but there's a reason that _Path of Exile_ has the reputation it does. I love the _idea_ of that game, but I don't think I'm ready to go back and get my Doctorate in Quantum Mechanics to be able to fully understand the fucking thing.

Enter _Last Epoch_, which I used to pronounce "Epoch" and not "Epoch," but have since settled on "Epoch" to differentiate it from the first "Epoch" pronunciation. _Last Epoch_ has shown me the light, and helped me understand that for all of _Diablo IV_'s flash, it fizzles in some key areas. The most glaring of which is itemization. _Diablo IV_ has some truly exquisite combat, but after playing for just a few dozen hours, I realize how unexciting chasing gear was in that game. It was disappointing to see a Legendary item drop, equip it, and find that my character never felt all that different or more powerful. And without a meaningful way to craft or enhance my gear (or even create an interesting build for my character) to help boost that power fantasy, the game started to feel like a dull grind. _Diablo IV_ seemed to sand down and homogenize the experience for everyone, so nothing ever felt truly unique.

This is what _Last Epoch_ nails. It is a game that is not afraid to have a strong vision, and allow players to build a character that feels powerful and fun, regardless of how you want to play. Chasing gear drops is fun, the builds are unique and interesting, and crafting—holy fuck, the crafting!—is so rewarding, it makes the grind immensely enjoyable. When a single item can twist your build into something new and interesting, it offers a ton of incentive to kill monsters, loot gear, and leverage the crafting mechanics to find that one perfect piece that will complement your playstyle. Looking back, it's obvious, but I am so glad that _Last Epoch_ came around to show me what life in this games _can be_. It'll give me something to gnaw on until the _Path of Exile 2_ beta later this year. Holy fuck.

### Expeditions: A MudRunner Game

Early on in my journey playing _SnowRunner_, the previous entry in the _MudRunner_ series of games, I drove my big truck into a puddle of mud and spent—I am not exaggerating—well over 30 minutes working my tires left and right, rocking the vehicle back and forth, in a desperate attempt to save myself from having to recover the vehicle at the garage and make the drive again, even though doing so and circumventing that specific mud puddle would have likely been far more expedient. But it was the _principle_ of the thing. I was determined to find a way to get myself out of this mess, even if it meant that my truck would be running on fumes as I rolled into my destination.

And, guess what, I fucking did it. Through a series of strategic winches, a mastery of the different levels of my gearbox, and whatever the fuck a differential is, I managed to get my truck out of that mud. It was long, it was arduous, and it was one of the most exciting moments I've ever experienced in a video game.

I have said it before, but I will declare it publicly here: _SnowRunner_ is one of my favorite games ever. In over three decades playing, I have never experienced anything quite like it.[^3] If there was ever a video game that embodied the idea of "I got myself into this, I can get myself out," it's _SnowRunner_. Its unique blend of geographic traversal and off-road physics makes it quite unlike any other, and I adore it for its slow-paced, methodical driving that is both impossibly dull and obscenely invigorating all at the same time. I love picking a truck, driving it around, and trying to complete the game's weird little tasks with it, even if there are probably better vehicles for the job. They've managed to make the simple act of getting from point A to point B riveting in a way that no other game can match.

_Expeditions: A MudRunner Game_ is _more of that_, albeit packaged in a slightly different, mission-based offering that aims to make the series slightly less inscrutable, slightly more approachable than the previous titles. Yes, there is a certain inherent charm in _SnowRunner's_ strange, bleak, sort of post-apocalyptic-adjacent open world of chores, but _Expeditions: A MudRunner Game_ is, without a doubt, _more_ of that sickly satisfying puzzle game wrapped in a driving game. I don't find myself getting too upset at the slight switch in format, because at the end of the day, I'm still trying to get somewhere, and there's a big swamp full of exquisitely rendered mud and water that I have to find some way to traverse.

I had nothing but high hopes for this one. Those hopes were not dashed. I'm here for it.

I don't know how 2024 is going to conclude. I'm still trying to hold on to the hope that we're not going to elect Donald fucking Trump again, so that anxiety is looming. But from a gaming perspective, the year is off to a remarkably strong start. Christ, by all accounts there are at least three other "game of the year" contenders that have come out that I have zero interest in playing! There truly is something for damn near anyone, and for that, I am thankful.

At least I have plenty of things to keep me busy for the next couple weeks while I wait for _Dragon's Dogma 2_ to release. I swear to god, if that game isn't amazing, I am gonna _SCREAM_.

[^3]: Yes, I know _Spintires_ and _MudRunner_ exist, I just never really got into either of those.
