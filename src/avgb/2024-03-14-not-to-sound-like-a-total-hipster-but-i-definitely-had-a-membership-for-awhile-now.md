Hi. Here I am telling you that you are able to [pay me one whole U.S. Dollar per month](https://ko-fi.com/gkeenan/tiers) (or whatever amount you think is fair), and this is **not** something I've set up because [I saw Robb do it](https://rknight.me/blog/one-a-month-club/).

Look, I am 100% not above just shamelessly hopping on [whatever trend Robb is doing right now](https://defaults.rknight.me). Robb is my friend. I like him. He's great and smart and extremely handsome. I like his ideas and I like his website and, you know what? I like his whole dang vibe. If you're gonna rip off anyone, rip off Robb, is what I always say.

_However_, this is one of those moments where I do want to point out that I've already been doing something _prior_ to Robb, and I'm totally not getting weird and defensive about it, but merely just setting the record straight, because I do feel as though I only have a limited number of times where I can publicly follow his lead before people start to seriously question whether or not I want to _be_ Robb.

For the record: no, I do not want to _be_ Robb. I'm weird, but, like, a healthy amount. Promise. (Robb: _promise_.)

Anyway, what I _will_ admit is that Robb did beat me to the part where I _actually tell people_ about the fact that I accept support (monetary or [otherwise](https://gkeenan.co/support)), which is something I have, up until this point, felt loathe to do, because—like, if I'm being really vulnerable for a second—there's a lot of deep-seated insecurity and a smorgasbord of self-esteem issues boppin' around in the ol' noggin and, as a result, my default state of being is one of perpetual self-imposed devaluation. It's hard for me to consider that what I do has merit,[^1] that it makes people feel something or think about things in a new way. How dare I assume that people would want to _pay me money_? Not to mention that I am just decidely not a fan of Capitalism as a concept. I think it's pretty fucking gross how much we, societally-speaking, tie remuneration to someone's value as a human being.

But, also, I gotta eat. Bills gotta get paid. I didn't go hundreds of thousands of dollars into student loan debt for nothing.[^2]

This is a lot of words for me to just say: "Hi. If you like what I do and you want to help me in my endeavor to make art and put more good than bad into the world, I would greatly appreciate your support."

Perhaps I'm not your cup of tea. That's fine. I get it. I'm not my own cup of tea either a lot of the time, but only one of us has to live with me all the time. That being said, [Jarrod](https://micro.blog/jarrod) has put together a [list of sites who offer similar memberships](https://oneamonth.club), and one or more of those _may_ be your cup of tea. Support them instead. I'm not picky. I just think it's nice when people make cool shit and other people reward the making of the cool shit.

Okay, bye.

[^1]: Which, hilariously, is the [whole fucking reason I decided to make this stupid site in the first place](/about).

[^2]: I did _that_ because I’m a fucking idiot.[^3]

[^3]: And also we give way too much responsibility to 18 year-olds who have been told their entire lives that they _need to go to college to be successful_, but we don’t give them _nearly_ enough information on what it means to take out a loan with a 14% variable interest rate. The fact that I was permitted (nay: ENCOURAGED) to do that when I had barely started growing facial hair just a year or two prior is criminal!
