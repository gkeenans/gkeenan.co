Our store didn't make enough money that quarter, so one of the managers brought in a "shaman" to ward off bad spirits.

_Sorry, what the fuck?_

Yeah, that's basically what I said when a colleague approached me to tell the tale of how he came in for his shift that morning, only to discover that he and a number of our other colleagues were unexpectedly witness to a ritual aimed at ridding our store of the spirits hindering our ability to hit our revenue goal. Apparently an actual animal carcass was involved... Look, all I know for sure is that some employees got upset and complained, there was an internal investigation by Corporate, and eventually that manager was offered another role in a strange state _far away from us_.

I worked for Apple over a decade ago, during what many current and former employees have described as the end of the Golden Years of Apple Retail. That magical era when the company purportedly cared about nothing more than providing a incredible experience to its employees and its customers.

Apple's Credo, given to all retail employees in a little booklet that fit in the back of our lanyards, led with the simple phrase: Enriching lives. The first sentence inside that booklet read: "At Apple our most important resource, our soul, is our people." I would go on to repeat that phrase verbatim, with no hint of irony, to hundreds of employees. The Credo was how I lived for three years, through the good times and the not-so-good times. I embodied its words—I infused them into every training session I ran. They informed how I made decisions.

At Apple, we were told that every team member was a steward of the brand. Each interaction, however slight, was an opportunity to connect and deepen a relationship with customers and potential customers. Our actions as individuals reflected the brand, and therefore, our values as individuals and the brand's values were the same. Implicit was the idea that each of us had a responsibility to be good stewards. We were often trusted—nay!—_instructed_ to make the decision we thought was best for the customer. It was not uncommon to ask a manager on the floor what we should do in any particular situation, only to have them respond, "What do _you_ think we should do?" Sometimes that meant spending an extra 30 minutes with a trepidatious new iPhone owner to show them the ropes of their device so they could leave the store with the confidence they needed to truly love it. Sometimes it meant loosening our return policy.

And then there were situations where it meant truly changing lives. Something that sticks with me to this day was the time I was answering phones in Back of House. In the midst of informing callers of our store's hours and helping others book Genius Bar appointments, a call came through with a person on the other end who sounded frantic, dismayed. He said he was rushing to the city because his wife called him from the ER of the children's hospital a couple blocks away from our store. Their young child had fallen down the stairs and was unresponsive. His wife realized only after arriving at the hospital that her iPhone's battery was nearly depleted, and she couldn't find a charger. She was worried that it would stop working while she was trying to keep the rest of the family informed, and the husband asked me if there was any way that he could pay for a charger over the phone and have someone get it to the hospital. At that time, we weren't equipped to handle purchases over the phone like that, so I told him, "Don't worry. I'll get a charger to your wife."

When I told my manager I wanted to comp a charger and run it over to the hospital, there was zero hesitation. I mean, what's a $29 piece of plastic mean to the richest company in the world when it means the world to this family? So we zeroed it out in our system and I ran to the ER and left it with staff members who assured me they would take it to the wife.

I never heard back from the family. I don't know what happened with their kid. But I do know that I did the right thing, and it was Apple that made me feel like that was the only choice I had.

I promise that I am not telling that story to brag about how fucking amazing I am or anything, but rather paint a picture of how Apple got me to believe for a long time that it was, in fact, _different_. And, yeah, I'll be the first to admit that I left the company instilled with a bit of _unrelenting optimism._[^1] In my experience, there was something magical in the way that Apple's idealistic rhetoric often connected with reality. It is unusually adept at creating ardent supporters, oftentimes out of its most dedicated employees. These were people who wanted to be a part of something bigger, who wanted to make a difference. True believers, some would say. Fans, cheerleaders, shills, apologists, cult members, whatever you call them. But when the company you work for emphatically declares that a core part of its existence is to make the world a better place, and then seems to _live up to that promise_, it's hard for all but the most jaded cynic to not get swept up in the fervor.

It was for me. And that helped convince me for a long time that Apple's more capitalistic inclinations were somehow... Noble? How could it be anything but? Apple believed in their people, their most important resource, their _soul_. Retail wasn't some second-class citizen that existed merely to peddle their wares. It was an integral part of helping people build relationships with the company and its technology. Apple Stores weren't _stores_. They were community centers. They were _places to be_.[^2]

Sure, most days working at the Apple Store was like working for any fucking retail store. And yeah, I did, of course, find it strange how much Apple emphasized statements in the Credo like: "We are at our best when we deliver enriching experiences that help owners of our products get more out of our technology and out of themselves," while placing equal, if not _more_ emphasis on statements like: _Sell more AppleCare._[^3] But these were [desperate times](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benzingainsights/2012/08/21/apple-now-most-valuable-company-in-history/?sh=7c4f833fbf67), so I suppose I can understand why I might've forgiven a bit of philosophical misalignment.

The point is, it's not like I didn't see the cracks in the façade. "The Ritual" wasn't the first time I cocked my head to the side and thought, "Ummmm... Is everything on the up and up here?" But with the benefit of hindsight, it does stand out as a notable example of how someone in leadership might respond when empowered to make a decision that best reflects the values of the brand. What else do you do when the threat of missing quota looms large overhead?

Think different. _Call the shaman._

Is that what Tim wanted? Is that what Steve would've wanted? Who's to say?

But I do know that other cracks come to mind. Some decisions effectively shifted the entirety of the store's morale overnight. Like the time Tim Cook hired interminable dope, John Browett, whose claim to fame prior to joining Apple was resuscitating British retailer, Dixons. He did this, of course, by cutting swathes of staff and milking customers for every last penny (sorry: pence) in every shitty, scummy way possible. Obviously, this was a completely sensible hire for the richest company in the world whose stores generated [more revenue per square foot than any other retailer](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-store-facts-2012-6#apple-now-generates-an-average-of-49-million-of-revenue-per-year-per-store-that-equates-to-sales-per-square-foot-of-a-staggering-6000-per-year-thats-more-than-twice-as-much-as-the-next-closest-retailer-tiffany-11). John brought a unique approach to elevating the prestige of the Apple Store by... cutting staff down to the point where nearly every shift was run by a skeleton crew, and introducing _new, innovative customer service opportunities_ such as "One-to-Many," where Specialists, Creatives, and Geniuses alike were expected to wrangle multiple customers at once and perform shared interactions.[^4] In practice, it felt as though we were no longer supposed to care about meaningful, personalized connections with our customers. Instead, if there was a group of people hanging around the iPads, our job was now to try and execute multiple iPad transactions at one time. Do as much as possible with as few resources as possible.[^5]

Anyway, John was very, very successful and went on to enjoy a [long and illustrious](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/no-surprise-browetts-reign-over-apple-retail-a-short-7-months/) career on the Apple Executive Team.

Then there was Frank (not his real name).

Working at a flagship location in a major city, Frank's was about as familiar a face as you could get amidst the thousands of tourists and locals and employees who meandered through the cavernous, limestone box every day. Frank was there most days to help people buy iPhones, which was a little strange, considering he didn't work for us.

At that time, iPhones in the U.S. were almost exclusively sold with two-year contracts on one of the major carriers. I'm sure many of you reading this are familiar, but in case you aren't, those two-year contracts were good, (mostly) guaranteed business for the service providers, and to incentivize people to commit to said contract, they would subsidize the vast majority of the cost of a new iPhone. Essentially, you commit to paying the carrier 60 bucks a month for two years, and that little $1,000 pocket computer is suddenly $199. What a deal! Failure to see the contract through would result in, at best, hundreds of dollars worth of early termination fees, or, at worst, your credit score tanking as a result of delinquent payments, not to mention relentless harassment from collections agents.

So as Specialists, our process for most iPhone transactions was to have the customer input their personal identifiable information, agree to the terms and conditions of the contract, and consent to a credit check. If their credit was good enough, they'd sign up for a new carrier plan and walk out of the store with a reasonably-priced fancy glass brick in their pocket. Easy-peasy.

Frank was there to help facilitate some of these transactions, and by "facilitate some of these transactions," I mean he would show up multiple times a day, each time with a brand-new person in tow. The people accompanying him followed his lead, and they all invariably exuded an aura I can only describe as _perpetual befuddlement_. Frank (or other handlers in Frank's crew) brought these people in, demanded whichever phone was in stock, and told his new companion to complete the credit check. We were always instructed to talk directly to the person actually signing up for the contract, so that we could ensure that they fully understood the terms of what they were signing up for. But doing that meant you also had to navigate around Frank's propensity for interference as he tried to commandeer and move things along, which would happen frequently when the "customer" didn't seem to comprehend what exactly it was they were doing, why they were there, or what future consequences existed.

Oftentimes, their credit wasn't good enough to get the full subsidy (or any subsidy at all), and when that happened, Frank would tell them, "Come on," and usher them out of the store, only to return minutes later with someone new.[^6]

When their credit _was_ good enough for the full subsidy, they were instructed by Frank to create a brand new account with a new, randomly-assigned phone number—_always_ a new number. And if their credit was _really good_, they would repeat this process with additional phones on the same newly-created account.

Once the phones were paid for, Frank would take the devices when we tried handing them to the "customer." Strangely, these folks were never interested in opening and setting up the phone in the store, like people usually did when they got their hands on their shiny new product.

My colleagues and I assumed that Frank was taking these subsidized phones and reselling them. iPhones were a hot commodity after all! So if you could manage to get one for a cool 200 bucks, it wouldn't be tough to turn a profit, especially if you didn't have to worry about being on the hook when AT&T or Verizon came knocking for their monthly payment. Of course, I don't know with absolute certainty that Frank's intentions were nefarious. But we were sometimes selling dozens of phones to him and his partners each day, so it seemed... suspect, if I’m being generous.

If you're reading all of that and thinking to yourself: _Hey, that sounds shady as fuck!_ You know what? We did, too! It didn't take long for the conversation amongst me and my colleagues to veer into the realm of: "This feels criminal? Maybe we shouldn't be allowing this???" I know, we were _soooo dramaaaatic_.

For months, we complained to our managers. Many of them shared our concerns, but offered no solutions.

Eventually, during one of our daily meetings, we received a statement from store leadership laced with the glittery, euphemism-driven Apple-speak we were all so accustomed to receiving from on-high: _We understand your concerns. We believe it's important to provide incredible experiences to all of our customers. The way we see it, eventually these phones will end up in the hands of future Apple owners._ Yada yada yada—It's been too long to remember a direct quote, but, holy shit, did it feel bad.

From their response, the message seemed clear: all that mattered was that the phones got sold. That we met our numbers. That we made the money. Those iPhones would end up in a _real_ customer's hands sooner or later. It didn't matter that lives could be destroyed in the process. It didn't matter that people who seemingly didn't understand what was happening were being taken advantage of. It wasn't our job to police the situation. Just move the product. Grind away.

At the time, I felt dismayed, betrayed. Many of my colleagues shared similar sentiments: This was an injustice, and it felt like all the high-minded rhetoric of _making the world a better place_ was merely there to inspire complacency. As long as we sold the iPhones, we could lie to ourselves that we were doing our part in "enriching lives."

I don't know how many iPhones we sold to Frank or his compatriots in total. Hundreds, maybe? Does it matter? From my perspective, even one was too many. If we were supposedly _stewards of the brand_, how do you reconcile being asked to turn a blind eye to your own values when they no longer align with the company?

There were a lot of reasons why I left Apple. I was also tired of watching my friends get strung along with the promise of promotion, only to be disappointed after months and months of toiling with additional responsibility, no increase in pay, and the job instead going to an external hire brought in from some big box retailer. I was tired of feeling manipulated by the empty platitudes espoused by managers. I was tired of being told that I was valued for my unique skills and perspective, only to have my suggestions or concerns discarded in the next sentence.

In short, Apple wasn't that much different than any other fucking company out there, and it sucked to have that image shattered.

The fucked up thing? I look back at my time there with fondness. Fondness obfuscated by the patina of cynicism, but fondness nevertheless. Apple taught me a lot about myself. I left there a more complete person. I had a clearer sense of purpose and identity. A more well-defined sense of justice. I've always maintained that working for Apple taught me more in three years than I ever learned floundering in college. I still believe that. I am, ultimately, grateful for who I became while working there.

And I still (mostly) love their devices. Apple has helped me get more out of their products and out of myself. Hell, I use them every single day. To create art and make sense of the world around me. To connect with friends and family members. To find inspiration, joy, and community. It would be dishonest to simply dismiss the fact that Apple has affected my life in an immensely positive way.

But that comes at a cost.

Even in my brief time with them over a decade ago, I witnessed too many people ground up in Apple's pursuit of more. No matter how much you may believe that they are ultimately a force of good in the world, remember that if it ever became a choice between you and selling another iPhone, that iPhone is going to get sold. You don't win capitalism through altruism. [Apple is not the exception to the rule: there are no exceptions.](https://inessential.com/2024/01/17/corporations_are_not_to_be_loved)

The company I see today. The company that has rooted itself in so many industries and leveraged its influence in said industries to stifle competition. The company that approaches regulation with spite, that seems to relish in any opportunity to flex their muscles of malicious compliance. The company that has built up a walled garden so all-encompassing that it feels damn near impossible to escape. The signs were always there.

I used to read the Credo and think that "At Apple our most important resource, our soul, is our people," was a promise. But when I read that now, it feels like a threat. Like Apple doesn't intend to nurture its most important resource. It intends to consume them.
