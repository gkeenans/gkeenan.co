Today is day 2 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “Float On” by Modest Mouse.

I failed Driver's Ed. the first time.

This, of course, was not a reflection of my actual driving ability[^1] or my thorough understanding of the _Rules of the Road_.[^2] By the time the final semester of my sophomore year was over, I had not only earned top marks on my actual driving assessments, I also passed the written exam with flying colors. By the admission of my teachers alone, I should've passed. But I had missed too many days of school that year. The administration had no choice but to fail me on a technicality.

The diagnosis from my therapist was Chronic Depression, and, yeah, I mean, that tracks. I was not a particularly happy teen,[^3] and as my unhappiness grew, I became more and more adept at faking sick to convince my codependent mother to let me stay home from school. Anything that kept me away from the oppressive, cavernous halls of GHS felt like a win. Every day I had a "fever" was a day I didn't have to worry about some dickhead who was going to dump his bottle of water on me, or wrench my textbooks from my hands, or hit me in the nuts while I walked by. Every day I was home sick was one more day I didn't have to bashfully tell my teachers that I hadn't completed the homework assignment. My life at that time was defined by finding short-term relief with no comprehension of long-term consequences.

So: failed. No drivey for Keen Bean. The only thing I was actually looking forward to that year wrenched away from me. No one's fault but my own.

Coincidentally, it was around that time that the incessant arguing between my mother and father culminated in us moving away from the distant Chicago suburbs[^4] to a more affordable house out in the much more distant country. We traded Starbucks for soybeans. The 300-kid high school class I despised was replaced by an entire school of just 270 kids brought in from five different towns—not exaggerating. The closest stop light was a 30 minute drive away.

Life changed a bit.

Because I still had a job in my hometown, my mom was on a mission to get me my driver's license ASAP so she and my dad wouldn't be responsible for getting me to and from work back in the 'burbs. I spent the summer between Sophomore and Junior year attending a private Driver Education school, relearning the things I already knew. Miraculously, this one actually stuck, and at the end of the however-many weeks I spent attending those classes, I was cleared to take the real exam at the DMV.

I passed on the first try. I was now free to drive the minivan (mom's car) or the seafoam green 1995 Toyota Tercel (dad's car) whenever either was available. I was usually stuck with the Tercel.

To call it a "car" in the first place feels generous. It was a soap box with wheels, retrofitted with an engine. It all felt very _illegal_ to be driving on the same roads with actual cars. 120,000 miles on the odometer. A clutch that needed to be bested in physical combat to actually change gears. And when you drove it above 60 miles per hour, it shook so violently that it's a miracle the thing didn't dissolve and send the passengers sitting inside spilling out onto the roadway to be ground into a fine paste.

My little cheapo portable CD player came with me everywhere when I drove that car. It played the CD through the car speakers via that weird little cassette tape that had a cable that plugged into the headphone jack. Remember?[^5]

It was a gigantic piece of shit. I loved that car. It gave me freedom. Freedom to explore. Freedom to be alone with my thoughts. Freedom to _scream._

I would crank up my music as loud as the speakers could handle, and I tried to scream the songs louder than that. I _screamed_ Slipknot. _Screamed_ Korn. _Screamed_ Kittie. _Screamed_ Snake River Conspiracy. _Screamed_ Limp Bizkit. _Screamed_ Staind. _Screamed_ Papa Roach. _Screamed_ Linkin Park. I burned a spindleful of mix CDs specifically to ravage my vocal cords and leave my body raw and broken. Barreling down long country roads, all that could be heard for miles was the whipping of the air through open windows, the rattling of a vehicle held together by chicken wire, and the impotent rage of a teenager.

All of the cruelty I absorbed in school, all of the chaos and anger I absorbed at home, erupted when I was the only person for miles. For so long, music had been my refuge. When I was alone on the road, it was my release. Just me and my feelings and the soybeans.

Somewhere west of Paw Paw, Illinois, a real town with a real population of (at the time) just 900 people, there's a wind farm. I discovered it by happenstance on one of my drives. Rows and rows of white titans towering into the air. Three lanky arms reaching out, slowly turning in the breeze. They are strange, alien structures. Unsettling in a way that's difficult to describe. Few things are creepier to me than seeing the silhouettes of windmills beset against a darkening sky. I always felt as though if I turned my back to them, they would reach down and pluck me from the Earth, remove my brain, and replace me with someone new and no one would ever know the difference.

For two years, I aimlessly drove through the country whenever I could. Roads winding between trees, up and over the tiniest little bullshit Illinois hills, through miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles of flat, nothing, fields of soybeans, corn and soybeans and corn.

And the windmills. No matter how many times I returned to them, they never got less creepy, but I kept going back.

When I graduated in 2004, my uncle gave me $500. Mom implored I save as much as I could—_which I did!_ But not before going to Best Buy and treating myself to two albums: _Franz Ferdinand_ by Franz Ferdinand and _Good News for People Who Love Bad News_ by Modest Mouse. These two albums became the de facto soundtrack of my solo excursions on the road. With time, my drives became less about screaming, more about grooving. More about singing. About softening. Appreciating. Resting. Soaking. Soaking it all in, shaking it all out, becoming more in tune with me.

Franz Ferdinand got me moving my body. It got me to sing. It was fun!

Modest Mouse got me to heal. _Good News for People Who Love Bad News_ is a quirky, beautiful album that, 20 years later, still feels as relevant and important to me today. It is timeless. My adoration for Franz Ferdinand has long waned. My adoration for Modest Mouse has only grown. I return to it often, and when I do I can't help but be transported back to who I was as at 18 years old with the clarity of who I am nearing my 40s. Bright blue skies. Open windows. My arm snaking up and down in the air. The heavy scent of nature filling my body. Learning to appreciate the flat, boring, nothing fields.

Highway 30 runs straight through the heart of a town called Shabbona, Illinois, where I lived for those two years. At the time, it was just 950 people. As of the 2020 census, just 862. It's a town that has seen its best days, and now slowly dwindles. I miss its quiet. I miss the long stretch of University Road, where it ended at Highway 30. You turn right to make your way toward town, and the road curves up and over the railroad tracks. At the precipice of the hill, you see fields stretching off in all directions into the horizon. A small nothing town enveloped by agricultural sprawl.

Have you ever stopped to watch a field of soybeans in Summer? The leaves wave delicately in the breeze, like tissue paper, and as they do so, they catch the sunlight in a way that makes the field shimmer and flow. An undulating ocean of green slowly surging over the land. Corn rises and rustles. Soybeans beckon. Set sail and go wherever the wind takes you.

The simple beauty of the chorus for "Float On" reminds me of soybeans.

_And we'll all float on, okay_  
_And we'll all float on, okay_  
_And we'll all float on, okay_  
_And we'll all float on, alright_  

It's a mantra of reprieve.

It's not enough to say it. You have to repeat it. You have to internalize it. You have to embody it. Life marching on is inevitable, but you have a choice of accepting it. Let the road lead you where it may. Enjoy the drive.

God, I miss that fucking piece of shit car.


[^1]: I had played a ton of Gran Turismo after all!  
  
[^2]: I was a nerd who was desperate to please people in authority after all!  
  
[^3]: Do those even exist?  
  
[^4]: Close enough to Chicago to just say "Chicago," when people ask you where you're from, but far enough away that when someone from Chicago asks and you say "Chicago," and they say, "Which part?" and you say "Geneva," they get _very defensive about it_.  
  
[^5]: To this day, I still don't know how those things fucking worked, and I'd really prefer to never learn. I will always believe it was some strange Eldritch magic powering them. Please let me have this.
