Today is day 3 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “Girl!” by Terror Pigeon.

We finally stopped to rest once we could touch the clouds. Stretched out around us in every direction, reaching into the atmosphere, an endless range of jagged peaks, mottled white, covered in pine tree peach fuzz. Dark splotches of diffused sunlight blanketed the crags, filled the valleys. Surrounded by the consequences of millions of years of tectonic friction, we basked in our accomplishment. The Earth was at once endlessly vast and impossibly small. We were thousands of miles from everything we knew. We were home.

I can still feel the cool air as it slowed my racing heart. I can still smell the scent of grass and trees and dirt and flowers dancing around us. I can still feel the smooth rocks in my hands as I grounded myself.

By the time we reached Hamilton Lake, my legs hurt, my lungs hurt, my back hurt. We climbed higher than the tallest building in the world! We hiked harder than all of civil engineering. There were so many times where I wasn't sure if I was going to make it. My body screamed. How did I do it?

We pushed. We climbed. We persevered. We persevered. We persevered.

And then we sat. We gazed around, dumbstruck. Our awe impossible to contain. We laughed.

I will never forget your smile that day.

I will never forget your smile. My favorite thing in the world.

_Please allow me_  
_To speak this clearly:_  
_There is not will nor force or power on this earth_  
_To keep you from me_

Betraying every philosophical and spiritual belief I possess, the connection we share feels as though it was inevitable. The Universe merely bided its time while we grew into who we needed to become. Nudged us together when we needed to grow further. With such power guiding us, what else do we do but overcome the insurmountable?

_And where I'm going_  
_Will you come too then?_  
_Cause all I want to do and see_  
_Would be infinitely better with you beside me!_

Of all the anthems we share, "Girl!" feels the most accurate encapsulation of us. Righteous, electric, optimistic. A propulsive, frenetic, emphatic ode to finding your person. The inexplicable bond that forms when you meet someone who gets you. The commitment you make over and over and over as you work to be better for each other. The adoration for the one you love. Who they are. How they help you see you more clearly.

_And you know what I know_  
_and you feel what I feel_

One of my favorite memories: the first time I heard "Girl!" and I knew I had to share it with you. The way we shook our hips, our butts, as the song built and built and built. Until it exploded! And we were just a chaotic mess of limbs flailing around the apartment. Not dancing, per sé. Conduits of energy.

I love how this song compels you to shout the lyrics. To stomp with the beat. To fill any space big or small with as much joy for its entire runtime, and then do it all over again because it never feels like one time is enough.

_I want to be there when you wake_  
_I want to be there when you need_  
_I want to be there when you laugh_  
_I want to be there when you speed_  
_I want to be there when you're hurt_  
_I want to be there 'til you're fine_  
_I want to be there for tonight_  
_I want to be there all the time_

One of my favorite memories: when we held each other and said "I love you" for the first time, changing everything forever.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

One of my favorite memories: both of us sobbing at _[Kitbull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZS5cgybKcI)_.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

One of my favorite memories: showing up so, _so early_ in the morning to be one of the first of three couples married in Cook County in 2020, only to be fourth in line.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

One of my favorite memories: how your compassion came through in the height of the pandemic when you had to sit with me and tell me how my anxiety and depression was affecting you. How I wouldn't have gotten the help I needed if it wasn't for you.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

Your laugh.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

Your voice.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

Your wit.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

How you make me laugh.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

The silly faces you make.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

The way you solve problems.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

Your endless pursuit of self-improvement.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

Your relentless optimism about people.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

The way you see me like no one else has.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

The way you make me feel safe.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

How I am so excited to see where we're going.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

How frequently we turn to one another and exclaim, "Oh my god, we're _married_!" Or "Oh my god, we have a _house_!" Or "Oh my god, we have a _dog_!" That for every bit that feels inevitable, feels equal parts improbable. I love rediscovering how exciting it is that we are here together.

_There is nothing about you I won't love_

I love how "Girl!" so effectively uses repetition to reinforce the joy and invigoration and awe and adoration and admiration and optimism of feeling seen and understood. It's a raucous, riotous celebration of finding the ones that accept you for who you are. An ode to the people in our lives that help shape us, who make life worth living, who help you see which mountains are worth climbing, and motivate you to persevere.
