Today is day 4 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “The Commander Thinks Aloud” by The Long Winters.

**Confession: As a general rule, I don't listen to song lyrics.**

To be clear, this is not a conscious decision, and I apologize to any and all musicians who put so much work into writing their lyrics. It's not that I don't _want_ to listen to lyrics. It's moreso that my brain doesn't process them. I have asked it to try, but up until this point it has politely refused.

When I listen to music, I can hear the individual words. I can sing along to the song (or at the very least reproduce close approximations to the sounds I hear). I can latch on to refrains. But interpreting meaning from any of this is, at best, a futile endeavor. I do find this strange, considering how deeply I feel music at an emotional level. But I form attachments to vibes, not linguistics. It's an intrinsic experience that has always been a core part of experiencing music. Something clicks or it doesn't. I can't explain it. I just feel.

I didn't even feel self-conscious about this until it got me in trouble with my first girlfriend! I put together a lil mix CD for her,[^1] and after she listened to it, she sent me a long email questioning my intent behind my inclusion of the song "Attitude" by Alien Ant Farm.

As a refresher, here's the first verse:

_Maybe I act on confused behavior_  
_Maybe waves crash like semi-trailer_  
_Maybe I'll spend my off-time without you_  
_It seems like we need our own space_

"'It seems like we need our own space'?" she wrote. "Are you trying to tell me something??"

My defense of "No! I just like the song!" did not do much to sway her. _Why did I like the song? Why did I put it on the CD? What does it mean?_ I don't know! I just liked it. It sounded good and I liked singing along to it and it made me feel things and I like feeling things![^2]

Look, high school relationships are hard and I do not recommend them.

Anyway, I bring all of this up so I can say: There are exceptions to this rule! And one of those exceptions is "The Commander Thinks Aloud" by The Long Winters. \[Pause for gasps.\]

Years ago, I woke up to a text message from a friend of mine who asked, "Hey, have you ever listened to the podcast, Song Exploder?"

"No."

"You should. I think you'd like it. Do you know the song, 'The Commander Thinks Aloud'?"

"No."

"Okay, listen to that episode and then the song. They're incredible."

"I will." And I did, because I trust this person.

30 minutes later, I was crying in bed. Trust maintained.[^3]

If you're not familiar, Song Exploder is a show where the host, Hrishikesh Hirway, talks to musicians and asks them to break down the creation of one of their songs. [You should listen to the episode about](https://songexploder.net/the-long-winters) "The Commander Thinks Aloud," and then listen to the song. They're incredible. It's worth it. I promise.

Hearing John Roderick give the touching, thoughtful interview about the impetus of the song, the collaboration and creativity that went into crafting the instrumental tracks, the emotional resonance of the finished work and how it impacts him when performing it. The added context, straight from Bean Dad[^4] himself, made listening to the complete track for the first time so meaningful that I couldn't help but be overwhelmed by emotion.

Judging it purely from a literalist perspective, it's a heartwrenching interpretation of the final moments of the crew of Space Shuttle Columbia. An effective, empathetic work that manages to strike a balance of hope and fear. The tragic beauty of the human experience illustrated by its abrupt end.

I feel such profound loss every time I listen to it. The joy, the excitement, the anticipation of the crew. The forbidden knowledge of the engineers who couldn't do anything but wait and watch as their worst fears became reality. The horrifying realization that your dreams and aspirations are dissolving around you, that the things you want more than anything else in the world are impossible to grasp, and there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.

_The crew compartment’s breaking up_  
_The crew compartment’s breaking up_

_The crew compartment’s breaking up_

Hopes and expectations. Experiences and dreams. We have so much life to lead, but at a certain point we come to terms with the fact that things don't always go to plan. Do you hide from the inevitable, or do you try and experience as much as you can so you live with the beauty while you can?

I do wonder how deep my emotional attachment to this song would be had I not listened to that episode. Would I have intrinsically understood the gravity of the work and what it was trying to say? Would I have heard and internalized the wonder and awe and fear that Roderick so effectively captures in his voice? Or is it only effective because I _know_ the intent? Would I revere the song like I do, without having all of that context?

I don't know. That's not how things worked out for me here. I can't possess the answer. Also we're quickly approaching [Death of the Author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author) territory here—a philosophy I tend to agree with—so perhaps, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. I either connect with a piece of art, or I don't. In this case, the additional knowledge adds a layer of understanding and empathy I might not have otherwise. But I can't possibly know everything, and sometimes I need to form my own narrative interpretations, creating beauty and understanding that may or my not have been there the whole time.

Maybe it's enough I get to experience. I get to feel. I get to share. Today, I'm here. Tomorrow, I might not be.


[^1]: And when I say "lil" I mean _lil_. It was one of [these](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SA48Q7DEL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)! Mini CDs! I loved them so much. They had room for like six or seven songs, but they were so cute and colorful. I had a very strange fascination with CDs that didn't have the typical silvery rainbow bottoms (especially black, like the bottoms of PSX discs), and these all had bottoms that matched their tops and jewel cases.  
  
[^2]: Still does! Great song. Go ahead and treat yourself to a listen.  
  
[^3]: Thanks, Chad!  
  
[^4]: I refer to this facetiously, of course. Fun fact: I watched the [Bean Dad debacle](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/bean-dad) play out in real time on Twitter, and it was actually the glass-shattering moment where I realized that site (and by extension [A LOT OF THE INTERNET](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/hey-so-i-think-i-fucking-hate-the-internet)) actually sucks so much shit. I have John Roderick to thank for me deleting my fucking account, and I've never looked back. Site sucks, and it's not Elon's fault.[^5]  
  
[^5]: It _is_ Elon's fault that it is EVEN WORSE than it was. Fuck Elon, fuck Twitter, and actually fuck Elon again just for good measure. Garbage person.__
