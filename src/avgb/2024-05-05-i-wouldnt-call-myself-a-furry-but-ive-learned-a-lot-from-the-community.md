Today is day 5 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “Fell Off the Face of the Earth” by Firewater.

The one and only time I ever submitted my writing to a contest, I won. It was a story about two elves. Tolkien-style. High fantasy. Pointy ears. Flowy cloaks. Keenly tuned senses. Desperately aware of their own immortality. There was, naturally, a _prophecy_ to fulfill. Their love would result in a transcendental shift and they would live out eternity as twin moons to be mythologized by future generations who looked to the sky for meaning and hope.

One of my classmates asked me where I came up for the idea, and I told them that it was the song "Fell Off the Face of the Earth" by Firewater. From the first verse:

_And the trees have been weeping_  
_Their tears are still upon the grass_

That seedling sprouted a grove, and the grove is where I discovered them; two elves embraced in a clearing surrounded by willow trees. They'd always been there, waiting for me to find them.

The twin moons came from... somewhere else. I made the conscious decision to omit the details for my classmate.

For so much of my childhood-to-early-adulthood, I felt alien. I don't know what exactly it was about me, in particular, that seemed so different. I don't know why I was incapable of fitting in. I don't know why it felt as though all the kids around me had some shared aversion to my presence.[^1] To this day, I do not recall any particular event that warranted my shunning, but at some point early on in my life there was a unanimous decision amongst my peers to keep me on the periphery. I eventually learned that things were just easier when I stopped trying to blend in, and I put my effort into minimizing my presence instead.

With real-life friendships a scare resource, I explored other opportunities for human connection. I found solace in The World Wide Web! Message boards. Pen pals. AOL chat rooms. AOL _RP_ chat rooms![^2]

And then I discovered a fantastical realm where I could shed all of my insecurity and be whoever I wanted to be, be whoever _anyone_ wanted me to be. None of the pesky baggage of my corporeal existence. A place where I could be a hero. A villain. A god.

_Sorry, what_—

[Furcadia](https://cms.furcadia.com/) became a refuge for me in the transitionary period of high school-to-college when my desperation for connection peaked. The promise of a world where the only limits were my imagination!!! ...And a rudimentary UI, serviceable isometric graphics, and very basic programming language called DragonSpeak. All of the packaging of an aggressively mediocre video game with the boundless possibility of freeform, text-based roleplay. I was obsessed.

I spent hours and hours creating new "Fursonas," building entire worlds around me, and engaging with other people who shared a similar passion for storytelling. I got to participate in a community, with none of the insecurity that plagued me in the real world. In Furcadia, I wasn't Keenan, social pariah and high commander of the überdork brigade. I was... whatsherbucket, dog thief and rogue adventurer looking for... I dunno, like, gold... or an amulet, or... something. I don't remember. Leave me alone, it was a long time ago! All I remember is that for a not insignificant chunk of my late teens I spent _a lot_ of time staring at a screen with little humanoid animal things sitting on cushions and just fuckin' _vibing out_.

But, more importantly, I remember my time playing Furcadia as being one of acceptance. A celebration of the creative and weird. A place where people could shed their skin and become versions of themselves they weren't brave enough to be otherwise. A place for people to play and share and discover free from the fear of judgment.

Oh and I also remember _the moons_! Duh! The whole reason we're here.

So one time I was sitting in a jail cell next to a rabbit, and we told each other about the harrowing journeys that resulted in us being imprisoned in the same dungeon. She told me about her home, a planet orbited by twin moons. It was told that one day, the moons would eventually connect and become one, and her people worshiped them as a symbol of eternal love.

The image of those two love moons stuck with me, so much so that when I discovered the elves in the song, I realized they would one day die and be reincarnated as the moons. Serendipity.

It's wild to me, how our brains associate things. Like, I can't listen to "Fell Off the Face of the Earth" without thinking about my one literary triumph: winning a stupid contest whose sole prize was the recognition of, like, 30 of my classmates.

Which naturally leads me to thinking about how sad and lonely I was for so long that I found myself looking for friendship and love in a video game.

I could see how someone might read that and feel pity, but I think of it as an incredible lesson of self-discovery. So often, our paths seem uncertain. Tumultuous. Counterintuitive. It can be hard to see beyond our immediate vicinity, especially when mired in despair. We all have expectations for how things should turn out, who we'll meet, how they'll treat us. We all experience the disappointment when those expectations don't match reality.

We tell ourselves myths to make sense of the world around us.

We find beauty in the moment the moons align and we connect with people who embrace our weirdness.
