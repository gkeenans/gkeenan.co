Today is day 6 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “Everywhere” by Michelle Branch.

I never made any sourdough.

No, my early Pandemic coping mechanism[^1] was clowning on doofuses in _[Warzone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Warzone)_, rolling with my posse through the city of Verdansk, spamming the horn on our jeep as we careened over cliffs and attempted to run down other players as they sprinted from building to building. It was four of us, Charles, Dom, Katy, and Keenan.[^2] Bloodthirsty, ruthless, competitive. Real capital G _gamers_, pwning n00bs and being 1337 and...

Ah, fuck it. Whatever.

Yeah, Warzone was a fast and frenetic action-packed, explosive first-person romp. It's easy to get caught up in the weirdly masculine fervor that twitchy military shooters exude. But I'm not gonna try and pretend that, for us, Warzone was ever anything more than a charming distraction. With the days blending into each other, spraying Lysol on our mail and buying hand sanitizer from distilleries and stocking up on any masks we could find and trying to understand why the fuck we needed to be on camera for the seventh fucking Zoom call that day... It was, frankly, just nice to have an activity to look forward to where we could distract our eyes and brains from the uncertainty of the world around us.

For months, we would meet up most days for our shooty pew pew boom bang video game for the opportunity to be social and feel somewhat normal. We'd talk about work. We'd talk about anxiety. We'd lament the seemingly boundless stupidity of Donald Trump and the fucking jabronis he surrounded himself with.

And then there was Dom, armed with puns and an affinity for early-2000s music, ready to pop off at a moment's notice to make us laugh as hard as we rolled our eyes.

One of us gets shot and needed a revive. Dom: "Just call me Vanessa Carlton, because I'm making my way over to you."

Someone throws a molotov cocktail. Dom: "Just call me Nelly, because it's getting hot in here."

The rest of our team gets murdered and Dom manages to evade them in a daring escape and somehow survive: "Just call me Destiny's Child, because—"

You get it. I get it. We all get it. The structure: predictable. Some may even dare to call it _corny_.[^3] And this was _incessant_. Dom's comedic brand hinged on quick interjections from the vast Encyclopedia of Pop Culture that was his brain. Any opening you gave him to make a passing reference to a song or show and he would take it. Unapologetic. Merciless. Completely devoid of shame.

And it was perfect. Chef's kiss. No notes. Like, _come on_! What more could you want? It was exactly what we needed—an endless stream of silly goofs and gentle reminders of a time when we were all rocking out to Avril Lavigne. As light and fluffy as so much of the pop music we listened to, paired with the comforting allure of nostalgia. And I say that as a person who _is actually quite averse to nostalgia in general_. But when it hits, it hits. And when your days were inundated by bad news, there was no greater palate cleanser than dicking around in a video game, cracking jokes with your friends, and remembering that, hey, at some point things didn't suck so much.

And then it ended. At a certain point, our interest in _Warzone_ waned, and there wasn't any other game that grabbed our attention in quite the same way. The days we'd meet up drifted further and further apart. We'd text and try and makes plans, or at the very least wax poetic about the next game to bring us together. But nothing stuck.

Then the vaccines came, and with them a gradual return to normalcy. Our world's had become so small during the height of the pandemic, but the reality was, it was me and Katy in Chicago, Charles in New York or North Carolina or Virginia, and Dom out in San Francisco. As fun as our online excursions were, it became harder and harder to coordinate four adult's schedules across three timezones when the world was springing to life around us again.

Ironically, I don't remember Dom's line that thrust "Everywhere" back into our collective knowledge, considering it's the song I associate most with that period. Years after most of the Pandemic dust had settled, I remember hearing it playing on the speakers when I was in the grocery store. I recorded a snippet as a voice memo and sent it over to him. We had a good laugh and it gave us a reason to catch up briefly.

Whenever I hear it, I no longer think of how much I loved it back when it came out in 2001.[^4] I think about how a global crisis made us rethink how we socialized as adults, and managed to bring us together so we could help each other through in whatever ways we could.

I truly, madly, deeply do not want to relive the days of the Pandemic, but I would be a liar if I said I didn't miss spending time with some of my favorite people, playing a silly game, and taking any opportunity we could to make ourselves laugh when laughter otherwise felt hard to come by.
