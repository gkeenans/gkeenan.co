Prior to 2005, I don't recall feeling self-conscious about my taste in music.[^1] But when I started dating someone new in college and we naturally began sharing our favorite songs, she laughed when I told her how much I loved "Toxic" by Britney Spears.

"Are you sure you're not gay?" she asked. Contextually-speaking, what with the aforementioned laughter and the incredulous scoffing, it was pretty clear that this was not a question rooted in genuine curiosity, rather a statement: you have bad taste and you should feel bad.[^2]

Unfortunately, this was not the first time, nor would it be the last, that someone mocked me by questioning my sexuality.

Because _gay = bad!_ That's the rule, right?

It was perhaps more overt when I was growing up in the late-90s through early-2000s, when "gay" was thrown around with more regularity, dripping with contempt. If someone ever needed to expend as little brain power as possible in expressing derision, "gay" was right there. There was no person ("you're so gay") or situation ("that's so gay") that couldn't be quickly disregarded as undesirable with a simple connection to homosexuality. "Gay" was a perfect catchall term for people who wanted to be hateful dickheads without any of the brainpower. Connotation does the heavy lifting.

But variety is the spice of life, so it's important that language evolves to provide options for any and all situations. Rampant homophobia was no exception. There were a number of terms I became well-acquainted with over the years, all of which sought to make gay people (or anyone people _thought_ were gay) feel unwelcome.

There was "queer." And queers obviously needed to be smeared. Smear the queer. It rhymed! And if being a young moron taught you anything, it's that if it rhymed, it was essentially law. "Whoever smelt it, dealt it." "Whoever denied it, supplied it." "Whoever rhymed it, crimed it."[^3] So, yeah, smear 'em all. Fuck it.

There was "fruit" (noun) and "fruity" (adjective). Both were deceptive, because, like "gay," they sounded fun. Whimsical, even! Fruit was delicious and sweet! Like candy! How could that be bad? You don't like bananas? Unfortunately, the banana is a cock, and you look like a fruitcake wearing that shirt, you fuckin' queer.

And then, of course, the one I feel closest to, due to sheer repetition alone: "faggot." I don't know if there's a word I associate more with my time in high school. "Faggot." There goes my backpack. "Faggot!" I'm walking down the street. "I'll fucking beat your ass, faggot!" Someone yells from across the football field‚Äîwhich, to be clear, I was _not_ playing on, because football was for cool kids, not some pussy-ass faggoty-fucking homo (me).[^4] Regardless of the word they chose, it was always clear that being even remotely associated with _gayness_ was humiliating. If you were gay, you were bad. Gross. Worthy of mockery.

"Sinful," is what my best friend in middle school told me. He said that gay people were going to burn in Hell. I told him my aunt was a lesbian. He said she was going to burn in Hell. That was about the time I started questioning Christianity's validity. It only got worse from there.

I distinctly recall the moment one of my friends came out to me in high school. Three of us in his car. He was driving. My girlfriend and I were in the backseat. He told us he was gay, and we were elated. And then he told us about how his mom cried at dinner. "I'm just sad that you won't be with us in Heaven," she said, before leaving the table. His dad stopped talking to him.

He described how, for years, he'd be secreted away in his bedroom, watching dudes having sex on his computer screen, jerking off and praying the whole time: "I'm not gay! I'm not gay!"

He said it with a laugh at the time. And, yeah, that's a funny image. But Jesus fucking Christ how awful is it for a kid to grow up hating themselves so much for merely existing. Can't even enjoy pleasure.

My own mother, someone I had come to know to be a loving, accepting person‚Äîa person with gay friends, gay family members‚Äîwondered aloud whether I was just going through a phase when I told her I thought I was bi. Later, she would explain that she was just worried, because she thought life would be a lot harder for me if people knew. But, you know, _still_.

I wasn't brave enough to tell anyone besides my closest friends until after high school, when I moved away.

It's interesting to watch homophobia evolve over the years. I went from my peers hurling slurs at me, to listening to my aunt and my cousin tell me that gay marriage would inevitably lead to people wanting to marry children[^5] or their pets, to having my own girlfriend mock my taste in music (liking pop music = gay!), to many people now trying to delicately walk this line of _appearing_ accepting of queer people, while still clearly holding the viewpoint that being queer is something to be ashamed of.

"No offense, but you sound like a gay dude," someone commented on a TikTok video I made. Yeah, thanks, I wouldn't have taken offense to that if you hadn't said "No offense," but clearly the underlying assumption is that "sounding gay" is offensive. So, like, what are we doing here?

Or another TikTok video I made where I was talking about experimenting with sobriety, and casually mentioned my wife, to which someone commented: "Wife? üòÇ" _Ha ha, isn't it hilarious how this person doesn't meet my criteria for masculinity, and therefore the mere thought of them being married to a woman is laughable????_

Not to get into the fact that I'm not even a dude. Where does that leave us now? Do we even have the time and energy to get into sexuality vs. gender identity?

I hate how defensive I feel when someone makes an assumption about my sexuality, if only because of how often it's a stark reminder that we're still very much steeped in a culture of homophobia. You have to have a finely tuned sense of people, their tone, intonation, and body language, so much of which is completely lost communicating on the Internet. It's dangerous to just assume "acceptance" is the baseline.

Despite the progress we've made as a society, the awareness and understanding we have, the language we've developed to support the LGBTQIA+ community, there are still barriers erected. Being queer is like walking through a minefield. A single step in the wrong direction can remind you just how unwelcome you are. It doesn't really matter how polite people are if they're talking out of both sides of their mouths. Shit still hurts even when they don't mean it to.

And that's not even acknowledging the resurgence of the Far Right. I don't have the fucking energy to think about those pieces of shit right now, I'm supposed to be writing about pop music.

To that point, I will say it has, thankfully, been a very long time since I've felt self-conscious about my taste in music. There has been a noticeable shift in the last couple decades, both in myself and in the broader culture. I can't remember the last time someone batted an eye when I expressed my love of Britney Spears, or Kesha, or Robyn, or Katy Perry, or Carly Rae Jepsen, or Lady Gaga, or Kelly Clarkson, or Beyonc√©, or Taylor Swift, or Nelly Furtado, or or or... So yay! That's great! People deserve to have simple joys. One of mine is pop music. It's been an important part of my own identity to just embrace it. I love the unabashed pleasure of a great pop song. I appreciate how a great beat, a catchy hook, and some simple, singable lyrics, can be empowering and fun. Sweet like candy, or your favorite fruit.

It's taken a lot of time and effort (and righteous indignation) to feel more comfortable with who I am and what I like. It's a nice feeling to not be ashamed of the things that make you feel good. It feels amazing to face people and take ownership of your identity. To tell them, in no uncertain terms: there is nothing you can do to make me less proud of being me.


[^1]: Except for maybe that one time when I was, like, 12, and my friends made fun of me because I was in a phase where I only really listened to "Pachelbel's Canon" and my double album of Edith Piaf songs.  
  
[^2]: Don't worry, we eventually broke up 12 years later.  
  
[^3]: "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit."  
  
[^4]: Fun story: my best friend freshman year was a kid who moved to the U.S. from England over the summer. We were in the locker room before gym one day when one kid called another kid a fag, and the gym teacher punished him by telling him to do a bunch of push-ups. My friend turned to me and asked why the kid got in trouble for the word "fag," and that day we both got to learn about some of the rich cultural differences between the U.S. and Britain.  
  
[^5]: That sure aged well for Republicans, didn't it? Weird how they're suddenly the party of "[if there's grass on the field, play ball!](https://www.nj.com/politics/2024/05/gop-official-argues-in-favor-of-child-marriage-girls-are-ripe-and-fertile.html)" Fucking pigs.
