Today is day 9 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “Fast Car” by Tracy Chapman.

"Schneider could be Butterbean," Mr. Hack said, gesturing to me with a laugh.[^1]

What were they talking about? Halloween? Movie adaptation? I was only half paying attention at the beginning of class, because I didn't really know (or care) much about boxing. But I had played _Fight Night_ for Playstation. I knew who _Butterbean_ was.

"Schneider could be Butterbean." Mr. Hack, pointing, giggling, at the chubby chubster, the little quiet dork sitting in the back of the class, me.

The joke was that I was fat.

It was in seventh grade that I learned that teachers could also be bullies.

Mr. Hack was my English—sorry, no, _Language Arts_—teacher that year, and he made me hate my favorite subject.

My entire life up until then, I excelled in English—Language Arts. The _art_ of language. Whatever you call it, I was good at it. Spelling? Immaculate. Grammar? Yes, actually. Phonics? Phuck my shit up.

My entire life up until then, I was a "smart kid" and I subsisted wholly on the praise of adults. I looked up to teachers. I wanted them to like me. I was desperate for their approval. Yeah, I was that kid. Maybe you hated that kid. You know who didn't hate that kid? My mom. Her love language was good grades, so I did everything I could to get her to love me.

My entire life up until then, I wanted to be a famous author. I loved writing. I loved _showing off_ my writing. I loved being seen in the way that quiet dorks do, the way that gets you sent home with the scarlet letter on your homework. I was such a little slut for school, and I was _proud of it._

My entire life up until then, all I craved was to be told I did a good job. Do that and you had me, hook, line, sinker. Reel me in and gut me, you'll find the glut of old report cards. A pile of vanity plates that all read AAAAAAA.

Am I overselling this for comedic effect? Maybe. Is it annoying to point that out? Also maybe. Am I trying to make a fuckin' point? Yes, and that's all you're gonna get from me on this one.

But I am not exaggerating when I say that Mr. Hack sucked the joy out of school for me. I dreaded his class. Dreaded his jokes. Dreaded his mockery. Dreaded how no matter what I did, it never seemed good enough. I think I got a C. Might as well take me out back and shoot me.

And yet, despite it all, I hoped. One of my perpetual weaknesses is trying to win people over. It's always been hard for me to accept that sometimes people just don't like me, and it was at its absolute peak when I was in school. The mere thought of not impressing a teacher? Devastating. Mr. Hack was not impressed by me. It was a sickness that festered in me the entire year. So when I sheepishly approached this lanky-ass man on the last day of school, yearbook in hand, and asked him to sign it, I guess I was hoping he'd write: _jk lol ur pretty kewl H.A.G.S.!_

Instead, he got one final cut in. _Mr. Schneider, looking forward to seeing you apply yourself next year!_[^2]

That. Bitch.

I want to blame Mr. Hack for my scholastic downfall, that his pedagogical shortcoming was but the first domino in an array of academic failure as I flailed and tumbled my way through the next five years, barely managing to scrounge up the passing grades I needed to graduate high school. But he was just an asshole, and I think my mental illness struggles were ultimately unrelated.

Dubs where dubs are due, I suppose, because I do remember one bright light in the miasma of despair that was his class, where a lesson truly lived up to the promise of marrying language and art.

One day, he presented us with a poem and asked us to read it. Study its structure. Analyze the rhyming scheme. Glean its message. Understand the switches in point-of-view. It was, all things considered, a nice poem. A poem read with the sterility of 12 year-old eyes that had yet to fully develop a discerning literary palate, but a nice poem.

But this was a lesson on how music was poetry. He wanted us to hear the poem sung by the writer. So after we spent countless minutes scouring the page, he pressed play on the stereo.

A simple, effective riff on an acoustic guitar. The raw, melodic voice of a woman breathing life into the words we had just spent the first chunk of class reading.

_You got a fast car_  
_I want a ticket to anywhere_

For the first three verses, a pattern emerges as Tracy Chapman sings. A lilt reminiscent of breathing. Alternating lines that balance hope with despair. You can hear the repetition of living with dreams just out of reach. The optimism of what's possible, confronting the reality of daily life.

And then the shift. The gas pedal pressed to the floor.

_So I remember when we were drivin', drivin' in your car_  
_Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk_  
_City lights lay out before us_  
_And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder_  
_And I had a feeling that I belonged_  
_I had a feelin' I could be someone_  
_Be someone, be someone_

The structure of the chorus, as written, completely shifts the feeling of the poem. It is propulsive. Evocative of the freedom you feel as you outrun a past, chasing a future. It moves so fast and so tonally different from the rest of the poem, it felt discombobulating to read initially. It wasn't until I heard her sing that it all made sense.

I don't know how anyone could hear that chorus and feel nothing. I don't know how anyone could experience Tracy Chapman singing and not want to speed alongside her as far as she'll take you.

The lesson I learned from Mr. Hack about the beauty of poetry and music—how it's impossible to separate the two—lives with me. Reading Tracy Chapman's words that day. Listening to her sing. She is fully connected to her truth. It shows up in her words, and it shows up in her voice. The two are indistinguishable.

As much as I try to leave my memory of that time behind me, when I listen to "Fast Car" I think about Mr. Hack. About how sometimes even the cruelest people in our lives, the people we should be able to trust, the people whose spectre chases us as we try to run far, far away, can still manage to leave us with something beautiful.


[^1]: Schneider is my last name. I hate it. Please do not use it. Thanks.  
  
[^2]: I don't have that yearbook anymore. I threw that shit away. But I remember the sentiment well enough.
