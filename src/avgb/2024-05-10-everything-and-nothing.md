Today is day 10 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “Soon We’ll Be Found” by Sia.

What's wrong?

I don't know.

What do you mean?

I don't know.

What are you feeling?

I don't know.

Why won't you talk to me?

I don't know what to say.

Just tell me what's going on your head.

Everything.

That sounds like a lot.

It feels like a lot.

So you're feeling a lot.

I am, but also no.

What do you mean?

I don't know.

Can you pick one emotion from the list?

Scared.

What are you scared of?

Everything.

Okay, let's try to narrow it down.

Me.

You're scared of yourself.

Yeah.

What scares you about yourself?

I don't know who I am.

Do you think other people know who they are?

It seems like it.

What would it mean to know who you are?

Everything.
