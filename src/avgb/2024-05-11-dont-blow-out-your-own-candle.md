Today is day 11 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “Us” by Regina Spektor.

My musical awakening began at summer camp in the mid-90s. I was, I dunno, ten? Eleven?[^1] One of the camp counselors—Dave, the _cool_ one—had brought his CD binder and spent three weeks indoctrinating us. We listened to a _lot_ of Hootie & The Blowfish and Blues Traveler on the bus rides to and from our various outdoor excursions. It was on those bus rides where I first heard Weird Al Yankovic. It was on those bus rides where I learned that you could say "fuck" in a song, and it was Alanis Morissette who taught me.

When I got back home, I begged my mom for two things: _Bad Hair Day_ by Weird Al, and _Jagged Little Pill._ I wanted to be cool like Dave, and I was convinced that owning those two albums would help me achieve that.[^2]

One of those requests was straightforward. Turns out, Mom also loved Weird Al! She brought me to Walmart so I could put the cassette of _Bad Hair Day_ on layaway, and while my allowance money accrued over the following weeks, we listened to her copy of _"Weird Al" Yankovic's Greatest Hits_.

She was, admittedly, a bit more skeptical about Alanis Morissette, but Santa didn't seem to express the same concerns. When I unloaded my stocking on Christmas morning later that year, I found a jewel case. The cover, red blending into blue blending into green. A woman's face framed by long, dark hair. In the middle, text: ALANIS MORISSETTE. In the lower-right corner, text: JAGGED LITTLE PILL. In another corner, text: PARENTAL ADVISORY EXPLICIT LYRICS. _Fuck yes_, I was finally going to be cool.

Santa also brought me my own boom box with both a tape deck and a CD player. Looking back, I'm sure that was more a gift for my mom than it was for me. Santa—what a guy!

I listened to _Jagged Little Pill_ on repeat for who knows how long. I adored every track, developing an affinity for certain key moments, as you do:

On "You Oughta Know," how the word "fuck" drips with seething contempt in the line: _And are you thinking of me when you **fuck** her?_

On "You Learn," how the words "feel free" take off like a jet.

And basically any time she sings a word that ends in the letter R. Was it an affectation? A deliberate choice? Does it matter? It was Alanis. And while she helped me learn the important lesson about how freeing it can be to sing swear words, the _more_ important lesson, at least in hindsight, was how crucial it was to sound like yourself. Prior to _Jagged Little Pill_, in my dumb ten year-old brain, music was supposed to be beautiful, melodic. Paintings should aim for realism, each brush stroke carefully considered. Writing needed to be grammatically-correct with excellent speeling. There were rules, and deviating from those rules was wrong. And Alanis was like, "_Fuck that_," singing through frayed vocal cords, spitting sibilants, and driving stakes through hearts with percussive verse. She showed me that there was true beauty in those moments of deliberate ugliness.

I can trace my love of unique voices through the years back to _Jagged Little Pill_. It was because of Alanis that my ears were tuned to perk up at Fiona Apple, or Jack Off Jill, or The Decemberists, or The Mountain Goats. It was because of Alanis that my eyes were drawn to writers like E. E. Cummings, or Zora Neale Hurston, or Toni Morrison, or Cormac McCarthy. Artists who looked at the mold, said, "Nah!" And did their own thing.

Is uniqueness a prerequisite to greatness? No, but I do think it's always special when you discover something novel.

And it was special when I first heard "Us" by Regina Spektor in 2004. I had just moved to Chicago for college when I randomly stumbled upon the music video—perhaps via StumbleUpon (RIP), back when the Internet was cool. I watched that video, listening to this person sing about statues and tourists and contagions(?), a whimsical, soaring song that felt nostalgic and romantic and angry. And then I watched it again.

And then I watched it again.

And then I walked 1.5 miles over to the Virgin Megastore (RIP) to purchase a copy of her album, _Soviet Kitsch_.[^3]

Like Alanis Morissette, Regina Spektor wields her voice in a way that I had never heard before. She oscillates between sweet, almost ethereal verses, formless, sweeping notes, and quick, repetitive bursts of sound—like a bird who swallowed a firecracker. One line spoken with her New York accent, the next a delicate, trembling vibrato. And then there are the songs where her music heaves from her chest, akin to singing through the Heimlich Maneuver. She powers through folk anthems, hammers the piano through frantic, haunting ballads, and bites like a fuckin' punk. No one turns on a dime like Regina Spektor. No one makes me feel romantic about music like Regina Spektor. No song gives me goosebumps like when she starts singing in Russian in "[Après Moi](https://youtu.be/Eq5inG547JA?si=oooMqydQ-LmWrr3N&t=696)." Sometimes she is soaring and optimistic, and sometimes she's a dainty auctioneer. But every time, she is herself.

I feel weirdly precious about Regina's music.

I once had a friend who made fun of how Regina Spektor sang. This person had the gall—the _gall_!!!—to claim that her voice was weird and ugly. I am not friends with this person anymore. Not specifically because of this incident, but it's a nice byproduct, never being subjected to their shitty opinions ever again.

However, it's also a prescient reminder that when you're making art, it will inevitably be divisive. I adore Regina Spektor's music, but I don't know if I would ever describe any one of her albums as a "perfect" album. I have that connection with other works. I could recite a half-dozen titles off the top of my head at a moment's notice. Entire albums that I could listen to repeatedly without skipping a single track. I'm sure my favorite tracks are someone's least favorite tracks, and vice versa.

Perfection is not a prerequisite for greatness, but being vulnerable enough to share your voice is.

This is why I always bristle when someone tells me they want to make something, but put up endless qualifiers before they even begin. I hear it often when people talk to me about voiceover. "I've thought about recording an audiobook, but I don't have a nice voice," they might say. My response is always the same: it's not about having a _nice_ voice. It's about having _your_ voice.

One of my writing instructors in college would interrupt students when it was their turn to share their work and they inevitably prefaced their reading with a sheepish disclaimer: "This isn't very good."

"Don't blow out your own candle," she said.

It's our job as artists to put ourselves on the page, on the canvas, in the photo, the song, the film. Our voices are valuable. Our perspective is valuable. The work is valuable. If you shut yourself down before the work is finished, you rob the work the opportunity to flourish.

Don't hold back in anticipation of the criticism. There will always be people to question, to criticize, to cut down. Taste is subjective and in woefully short supply. We can wait our entire lives hoping to makes something that connects with everyone, never giving any of ourselves to anyone.

So what choice do you have but to do?

Sing it, slur it, spit it, write it, paint it, draw it, work it, build it, make it, film it, fuck it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

[^4]: While you're here, can we just take a moment to relish this brief period in time? The period where I hadn't yet started buying music almost exclusively as singles on iTunes. I can't imagine what would've happened had my only exposure to The Faint been "Posed to Death," or had I never heard the rest of _Soviet Kitsch_ by Regina Spektor. Christ. Like, yeah, okay, iTunes was a revolution in how we accessed music, but it's just quietly dawning on me in this moment that I really lucked out. How many albums did I miss in subsequent years as $.99 individual songs dominated my music collection? Bleak!
