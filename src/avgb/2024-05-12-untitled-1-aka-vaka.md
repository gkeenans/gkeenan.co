Today is day 12 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “Untitled #1 (a.k.a. ‘Vaka’)” by Sigur Rós.

"Grammy has cancer," my mom said to me as I stood in the family room. She was seated on the couch, calm, looking at me with tired, serious eyes. It was at that moment I realized I didn't know how to breathe. It felt like my heart stopped. I could only hang my head and stare at the floor while tears fell off my cheeks.

I was 16, and this was the first time someone I knew had cancer. But I understood well enough to be scared.

My mom said she was surprised I reacted that way, and I said I was afraid that Grammy was going to die.

Grammy was my only grandparent I ever felt a connection with growing up. My dad's parents could be described, if we're being generous, as aloof. They favored my cousins more than me and my sister. Their collective disappointment in my dad trickled down a generation and left us feeling alienated and unwelcome in their home as far back as we could remember.

My mom's dad, Pa, didn't talk much. He fell asleep in his chair watching John Wayne movies. He was kind and gentle with us, but he was a hard man to know. He didn't demand much attention.

Grammy, though, was the entertainer. She was the one who watched us on the weekends. She was the one who took us camping in Wisconsin, long road trips with their big truck towing a camper, and introduced us to the zoo where we could feed and pet the deer. She was the one who would make us tomato soup with grilled cheese. She was the one who let us cover our Cheerios in so much sugar that you could scrape it off the bottom of the bowl—a milky, gooey sludge. She was the one who encouraged us to draw and read and sing. She was the one that got excited when we excelled in school. She was the one that asked me questions when I said I didn't believe in God. She was the one who still loved me even when she couldn't convince me otherwise.

She was the one who taught me that it's okay to feel.

Grammy wasn't warm. She _was_ warmth. Empathy incarnate. She loved to give big hugs. She loved to comfort. When she smiled, she smiled with her whole face. Two rows of teeth beaming. Her superpower was the ability to see any of her grandchildren crying, and know exactly how to make them laugh instead. She loved to laugh, and she loved to make people laugh. Sometimes she'd laugh so hard she'd start crying, and then she'd laugh through the tears.

And she could be such an antagonistic shit. In the weeks following her diagnosis, she began losing her hair. My aunt lived at home and took care of her, and they'd bicker in the way that family members do. When Grammy wanted to win an argument, she'd reach up to her head and delicately pull out a patch of hair, and let it fall, fluttering gently onto the couch or the floor, knowing that my aunt would have to clean it up. "Ope!" she'd say as she dropped a lock next to her. "Would you look at that?" And she'd flash a little smile to anyone else there. _What, you're gonna get mad at the little old cancer lady?_ She'd leave little trails of her hair around the house. Reminders that she had been there.

It's hard to recall much else from that period. So much of her illness is hazy for me. I remember the day Mom told me Grammy was sick. I remember the hair. I remember how, for months, my mom said after each doctor's appointment that everyone at the hospital seemed really optimistic. I remember the night that my mom, my dad, my aunt, and Pa took Grammy to the hospital because "she was retaining fluid and they wanted to keep her under observation."

And I remember waking up on the couch the next morning, the main menu of the DVD I fell asleep to looping on the television. My dad's hand was on my shoulder. "Hey, Keen. I—have something I need to tell you," he said. "Grammy passed away this morning."

The only word I could choke out was "What?" And then I cried. I went up to my room and I cried more. I cried until it hurt and then I kept crying.

The next few days were awash in tears. Mine. My sister's. My mom's. My aunt's. The week eventually culminating in a wake where we could all cry together. I watched Pa approach Grammy's casket, his knees buckled when he looked inside. My aunt buried her face in his chest. "That's not her," she sobbed. "That's not her."

And when I approached to see my grandma, I couldn't feel her warmth. Her eyes were closed. Her lips drawn into scowl I had never seen before. Her smile a quickly fading memory. She was gone. That wasn't her.

The weeks following her death are notable if only for the overwhelming numbness I felt... or didn't feel—numbness is weird. It seemed like I had given all the tears I could, and was then set adrift, an unfeeling blob sequestered away in my room, emerging only for the essentials or for school. It was in those weeks that I worried Grammy had taken my ability to feel with her. There was no laughing. No anger. No sadness. It was just me, in my room, staring at the computer or at the television.

I became disillusioned by listlessness. I thought I should take things into my own hands. I tried to brute force an emotional response by blasting my playlist of angry music. If I couldn't feel anything on my own, maybe Jonathan Davis could help me (he could not). I yelled and screamed and shook my body to the shredding guitars, but I didn't feel a thing. Someone had carved out my heart and left a gaping hole in its stead.

I didn't talk to my friends. I didn't go outside. I didn't eat much of anything. I sat and browsed the web, trying to find solace in distraction. I hoped for anything or anyone to help me.

Amidst the weeks of endless numbness, a friend sent me a link in an IM: _u should watch this. its beautiful_

The video for a nameless song from a band I'd never heard of.

It opened with a red flare, a halo filling the edges of the screen; the center, black. The inside of an iris looking at the stars. The drone of a keyboard, individual notes methodically walking up and down, accompanied shortly thereafter by a piano following similar steps. Delicate, unintelligible cries throughout. A scene of children in a school. They lined up. They underwent inspections. And then they rushed out the door and began running through a field of ash, wearing gasmasks. On the horizon, the carbonized trunks of dead trees silhouetted against a red sky. And a gentle voice singing in a language I didn't understand. I watched the children run and push each other, watched as their roughhousing turned violent at the charred chassis of a derelict vehicle. Listened to the beautiful voice singing nothing and everything. At a certain point, the singing stopped. The instruments all but abated. The song took a moment to breathe. The piano walked up and up and up until one of the children threw a pipe and smashed the window of the car. Jónsi's falsetto filled the silence.

Four minutes and fifty-four seconds into the song, I cried along with Jónsi. Everything I couldn't feel for weeks I felt in then. A devastating pain deep within me unleashed. A moment of immeasurable beauty immolating the veil of ennui. It was as though Grammy sat beside me and told me that I was here, and for as long as I was here, I would feel.

Sigur Rós described their album _( )_ as "unfinished." The songs untitled. The lyrics comprised of a language of gibberish (something they facetiously referred to as "Hopelandic"). The songs are what they are, and they wanted to let the listener decide what they meant. I can't imagine anything more perfect for me.

Grammy died 21 years ago. She's been gone from my life longer than she was in it. I have listened to "Untitled #1" for those 21 years, desperately hoping it could be about anything else. But no matter how much I hope, how hard I try, how many times I listen, it's about her. For four minutes and fifty-three seconds, I remember her smile, her laugh, her warmth.

And then, after a sharp inhalation, I remember the loss, the numbness, the feeling of emerging alive on the other side of grief.

Four minutes and fifty-four seconds is all it takes to experience the unbearable pain of being alive. As sure as the heat death of the Universe, at four minutes and fifty-four seconds, I will cry.

Years after she died, I got a tattoo on my left wrist. It reads: (Alive). A tribute to her. A tribute to the song.

When I look at it, I remember Grammy. I think of how much it still hurts to be here without her, but also how much joy and laughter and love I've had the chance to experience because she helped show me how.
