Today is day 14 of WeblogPoMo2024, a month long daily blogging challenge. I’m challenging myself to write about a song each day, but there are many other people writing about other things. You should [check them out](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators)!

Today’s song is “[Transistor Radio](https://song.link/us/i/1493241397)” by Cloud Cult.

When I was a small moron, I wanted nothing more than to be an adult. The mystical allure of age was intoxicating to me, and if there was any opportunity to position myself as older and sophisticated, I took it. I craved the validation of adults, which led me to, uh, let's say, exhibit some _embarrassing_ displays of performative maturity.

Some examples:

1. When I was 10, McDonald's introduced a burger called "The Arch Deluxe," which was marketed as, essentially, a cheeseburger for _adults_. I decided that I would only ever order The Arch Deluxe when we went to McDonald's, even though I invariably asked for it with most of the toppings omitted—relegating it to being a plain cheeseburger but with peppered bacon. My entire idiot personality for the duration of its availability revolved around how much I appreciated a "more mature burger."  
      
    
2. In, like, 5th or 6th grade, I started buying Stephen King books, because I wanted to read the books that cool, mature adults did, rather than the books I liked. This led me to reading my first ever description of a flaccid penis (if memory serves, Mr. King described it as "a dead whitesnake") and I thought _that was a pretty weird thing to put in a book!_ [^1]  
      
    
3. One time, I spent an entire day trying to convince my parents that I had been abducted by aliens the night before. My mom eventually yelled at me because I scared my younger sister. I don't think this serves to strengthen my thesis, I just think it's a funny memory—I was a dumbass!  
      
    

Anyway, the feeling I remember most from my childhood was a distinct sense that I didn't belong, and I was convinced that if I could just be an adult, my problems would be solved. I'd finally know who I was and what I was doing.

Now that I am a big moron, I, of course, realize that (say it with me, everyone) _no one knows what the fuck they are doing._ And that is its own special form of disappointment. When we're children, we lack the wisdom to appreciate our youth, and when we have the wisdom, it's impossible to go back and just not eat dozens of Arch Deluxes (Arches Deluxe?) because you didn't even fucking like them! And also adults are often extremely stupid! And cruel... But mostly stupid!

One of the reasons I find myself drawn to "Transistor Radio," aside from the fact that it's just a very pleasant listen, is that it is a painfully accurate portrayal of what it feels like to grow up. Specifically, that for a large portion my childhood, I had a number of trusted adults guiding me with what felt like sage advice. And then a couple of them died, and the others just, like, I dunno, didn't have anything else to say once I was out on my own.[^2]

It felt like the rug got pulled out from under me. For so long, it seemed like there was a plan. A path. Some _guardrails,_ at the very least, and then, I was older, but no less lost. A child in a big, hairy body. No idea what was going on, and definitely no closer to any concrete revelations about what I wanted to do with my life, what I was good at, or _who I even was_—you know, unimportant bullshit like that!

I know a core theme of the message of "Transistor Radio" is "it's the journey, not the destination," and Cloud Cult somehow manage to say that in the least trite, _live laugh love_ way possible. It is a lovely song and a lovely sentiment.

But I do also feel unfulfilled by it. I've spent so much of my life feeling lost, trying so hard to be something, anything for anyone, that I keep hoping that at one point I'll know how to be me for me. I want to relish everything I've experienced, take what I've learned and use that to make myself better. To give back to the world around me. But without knowing where I'm going, it feels like I have nothing to latch onto.

I just wish I had any idea of what I am supposed to be, how to get there, and how to be a decent person while doing it.

Is that so much to ask?


[^1]: While my bookshelf did proudly display _It_, I will admit that I never actually read the book. Bullet dodged!  
  
[^2]: Did they give up? Or did my acerbic, willful early-20s personality push them away? Impossible to say!
