Zach Gage found my website. Apparently I was a bit *too effusive* with my [praise for Puzzmo](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/you-should-be-excited-for-puzzmo-a-cute-as-fuck-daily-puzzle-smorgasbord-from-zach-gage) back when it first launched, and that led this game boy to believe he could send me an email appealing to my deep-seated need for validation. Well, *joke's on him*, because despite my complete lack of shame, I can not, will not, have not, shan't, and also REFUSE TO be manipulated into talking about [Pile-Up Poker](https://www.puzzmo.com/play/pile-up-poker), Puzzmo's new game that just officially launched yesterday, June 3(rd), 2024.

Frankly, if I were Game Daddy Gage, I would be *ashamed* by even the mere thought of debasing myself so thoroughly, chumming the depths of the indie web in search of a jamoke mired in enough self-loathing that they'd be willing to undermine the sanctity of their entire website with average monthly pageviews in the double-digits. 

I am flabbergasted by the gall of this man, who thinks that complimenting my writing and sending me a [free Joker card](/assets/img/puzzmojoker!.jpeg) *to my house in the mail* could in any way persuade me to thoroughly enjoy a daily Poker puzzle that manages to capture the essence of the most famous card game this side of Yu-Gi-Oh!, while also completely circumventing its worst qualitiesâ€”namely: interacting with people. 

You could be fooled into thinking that Pile-Up Poker is the perfect complement to the zany Poker roguelike(lite), [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/), in that both manage to bring a fun and refreshing twist to a very tired and bland game made for swindlers and cowboys. But I couldn't, for I am far too smart and secure to be bamboozled by flattery. 

I don't care that Pile-Up Poker is straightforward, fun, and rewarding to play. I don't care that they're offering a free deck of cards to [new Puzzmo subscribers ](https://www.puzzmo.com/subscribe), featuring truly delightful original illustrations from Bojack Horseman co-creator and illustrator, Lisa Hanawalt. I don't care that I smile basically the entire time I play this fucking game. I WILL NOT BE BOUGHT!!!

Look, I love a 4x4 grid as much as the next they. I love placing four cards per hand onto said grid in an effort to create the best Poker hand vertically, horizontally, AND on each of the four corners.. I love discarding the fifth card, with the discard pile becoming *yet another opportunity to create a Poker hand*. I love racking up multipliers. I love watching numbers go up. I love massive, community-driven objectives. I love uncovering secrets. I love whimsy!

But you know what I *don't* love? **Hubris.**

So, I'm sorry, Zach Gage, Lord Emperor of Gameville. You've finally met your match. It is impossible to trick me into praising you and the Puzzmo team for putting together yet another banger of a daily puzzle game, that you so generously offer *for free*, enticing me to subscribe to Puzzmo with EVEN MORE GAMES at an *even more generous price*. Pile-Up Poker might be absolutely delightful. It might be worth checking out, even if you don't like Poker, because it's just that fun. It might even be one of my favorite puzzles on Puzzmo yet. But it doesn't matter, because I am nothing without my integrity.
