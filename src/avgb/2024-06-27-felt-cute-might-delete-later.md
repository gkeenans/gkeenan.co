If you're seeing this in your RSS reader, it means I didn't completely fuck up the launch of my redesigned site. Hooray.

Yes, I successfully left Squarespace to venture off into the world of front end development, and have rebuilt this with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev). I'm planning a much more in-depth writeup[^1] of the process of learning how to code and build this thing from (mostly) scratch, for those of you sickos who like that kind of thing.

Until then, hi. This is my new home on the Internet. It's a bit different than what came before, but I think it suits me.

And if you're still just reading this in your RSS reader, then it probably doesn't look any different than it did before, so bye!
