title: I AM HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME

As I start this document, it is 2:46 in the actual A.M. and I have absconded from the warmth of my bed to bask in the putrid blue glow of this godforsaken monitor. If endless scrolling on a barely lit OLED wasn't conducive to sleeping, I shudder at the thought of what this is doing to me. iA Writer, for all of the beauty inherent in its minimalism, is quite blinding. I can see the little floaties bespeckling my cornea, they dance around with every microadjustment of my eye, little squiggly patches of blur flitting about.[^1] Are my eyes dry? Is it allergies? Is it cancer? Am I just old?

I am having a really hard time.

Eye floaties aside. Sleep deprivation aside. Presidential election rumination aside. *Could we be moving to Europe??* aside. I'm not currently wearing a shirt aside. The time I experience is dense, petrified, memories seized up into an impenetrable carapace. There's no chiseling any meaning out of it. Just a crust, cruft condensed, coagulated, coarse and incredulous.

I started writing an essay about my cousin a few weeks ago. My cousin died and I haven't cried for him. My cousin died and when we were kids he was who I looked up to more than anyone and then we became adults and I didn't even know who he was anymore and then he died. I've been sitting with this for nearly three fucking years, and now that I'm writing everything out to make sense of it, the closer I get to finally finishing this, the further away I feel from understanding.

I thought maybe taking a small break would help. Enjoy the wedding weekend in Chicago! Walk around the city. Take photos. Enjoy time with friends. Eat breakfast sandwiches from *Loaf Lounge,* you putz! You're on vacation. You can write when you're home. 

You can write when you're dead. 

No, wait! That's the whole point. You can't. You can't. What are you saying? You've got this one chance. He had his one chance. What good are you going to do when you're growing trees?

a really hard time

I don't even know if it's my story to tell. Is my reality valid? Are these feelings for the world or for me? What am I supposed to do with all of this *brain stuff,* keep it for myself? I am not a good steward!

and I guess I just want to tell him one last time that I love him. That I'm sorry we stopped talking after I quit Facebook in 2016, that I'm still angry at the person he became, the things he believed, the theories that killed him. Is there space for reconciliation or is it too late? Maybe I'll get a chance to ask him when the eye floaties finally come for me. For once, I hope he was right about God. Did He forgive?

What am I supposed to do now? Wrap it up into a thing and give it to the world and hope that that's enough? 

I'm trying.

I'm trying!

I'm trying.

Try harder.
