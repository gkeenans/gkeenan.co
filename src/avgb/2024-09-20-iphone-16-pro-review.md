title: "The iPhone 16 Pro Review: Finally, a little pocket computer that fills the gaping void in my soul"

I know it just came out today, but I am already ready to declare that there is no greater device than iPhone 16 Pro. I am flummoxed. Bewildered. DISCOMBOBULATED, even. It is the pinnacle of design. Of engineering. And of humanity. Once again, Apple has blessed us with a little pocket computer that instantly renders their previous efforts to the waste bin that is recorded history. iPhone 15 Pro? More like iPhone 15 **No!** THROW IT IN A BLENDER. Pulse pulse. Drink it up. The nourishing blend of battery acid and precious metals will satiate you as you conjure the wonders of your iCloud backup down into your brand new gleaming monolith.

My god, is there anything this phone can't do?[^1] Email! Messages! Photos! Holy shit, three cameras! You can take *every picture,* and you will love it. I love it. It's my favorite camera ever. Nay, it is my favorite thing. Move over, my wife. Get lost, my dog, Olive, who is adorable. I am now beholden to the slab of glass in my pocket. The great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchild of Steve Jobs.

Nothing can prepare you for how amazing this phone is. You've never seen anything like it. *I* certainly haven't. But I know it's great, because it is from Apple, and Apple is great, and [I've never been disappointed by them ever](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/the-meat-grinder/). They are the only company who can do this. Hell, they're the only company I *want* to do this. Can we please just cede Capitalism to Tim Cook already?

I understand if this all comes off as hyperbolic, but it's impossible to contain my excitement for something that has already changed my life in literally immeasurable ways. It feels like I've been waiting all of my 38 years just to hold in my hand this perfect golden idol—this Desert Titanium idol. Remarkable! I wasn't expecting to love it so much. (Okay, that's a lie. I did expect it. Oops!)

As a professional photographer, I am absolutely blown away by what I'll be able to do with the 48 megapixel ultra-wide lens, as well as the 48 megapixel Fusion lens, as well as the 12 megapixel telephoto lens. We're talking 108 combined megapixels! But let's break down the technical jargon for the laythey. 108 megapixels is *so many pixels* and it means your photos will look better than ever, because more pixels equal better photos. My photos look incredible, I bet! I thought I might be bummed out by the fact that I'll no longer have a 3x telephoto lens like I do on my iPhone 13 Pro, but then I remembered that I'm a fucking moron! 5x is more than 3x! Give me more!

As an unprofessional writer, I can't wait for iPhone to write all of my emails and text messages and blog posts. To be clear, I abhor AI, but Apple Intelligence just seems so much safer, more private, and less creatively bankrupt. It has to be—iPhone is at the intersection of Technology and Liberal Arts, after all. I'm very Liberal! I love art! Technology is great! This thing is *made for me.*

I didn't think I could love something like this magical Internet portal. The smooth glass. The buttons—all 4 3/4 of them. The USB-C port. The speakers. The LIDAR thing. The Face ID. Wow. Oh my god. Fuck. Holy shit. Christ! *CHRIST!* Honestly, I love this lil' guy so much I don't even know what else to say about it. I guess it is proof that there is actually an almighty with a very particular hyperfixation on our overall wellbeing? His favorite creations now receive a gift befitting of the title. A splendiferous object wrought of magic and wonder and—oh wait, one sec, doorbell. I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere!

Sorry, it was the UPS guy. Look what just arrived! Now I can love it for realsies!

<div class="imgcap">WOW!</div><br>

<div class="imgcap">HOLY SHIT! WOW!</div><br>

Even before opening the box, I can tell that my assumptions are completely justified. Don't just take my word for it. Actually, wait! Do. I am very trustworthy! Why would I lie? I wouldn't! I haven't. I can't. My integrity remains uncompromised. I am a vessel for truth, a blessing given to me by the Technolord. Her name is Cheryl. We are friends. I am your friend. Believe me. Our parasocial relationship is actually quite normal! iPhone! ipHone! ipHooe!

[^1]: Aside from all of the Apple Intelligence stuff they *clearly advertise* as being a marquee feature of this device. Someone call Lina Kahn maybe, I dunno, lol!
