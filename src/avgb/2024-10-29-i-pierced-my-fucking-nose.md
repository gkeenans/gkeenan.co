Or, I suppose, more accurately, I *got* my nose pierced.[^1] I am not advocating for you to pierce yourself, your friends, your pets, any tubers (aside from a nice potato, just to make sure it's done and ready to mash). It's unsafe. Please be safe when it comes to needles penetrating your flesh, thanks.

Is this worth a blog post? I dunno, is anything? Is a blog a blog if I can't blog what I wanna blog when I wanna blog? These are rhetorical questionsâ€”DO NOT ANSWER. 

It's a funny sort of thing. Brains, I mean. I remember for so long I was staunchly opposed to tattoos... Until I got one, and then I wanted another. And now I've been chasing that high ever since, waiting for the perfect artist to introduce themselves to me so I can get my dream sleeve. It'll happen. One day.

Same with piercings. Christ, I was such a dickhead about it to my ex, actually. She really wanted a nose ring and I was all "Yikes, ew" about it. Why did I think that? Why did I *care*? It was none of my business! But also, *why* did I *care?* What was it about the thought of a piercing that made me squirm? I wish I had the good goddamn sense back then to realize how frail and worthless opinions are.

Anyway, we split up over seven years ago at this point, and the last time I saw a photo of her, you better believe she had her nose pierced, and I just have to say: "Fucking *good for you.*" Don't let the bastards tell you what to do with your body. I shouldn't have said anything; it was stupid and wrong. 

And then, of course, here I am, 38. Tectonic plates of perception shearing and submerging and mashing together into a brand new range to gawp at. The new sun rising over, the entire vista awash with daylight, renewed. As I take it all in, a little glimmer of a *oh! What if? Maybe? Could I pull it off? Am I too old??* 

And then, with some gentle, divine encouragement. *Fuck it! What have I got to lose?*

Sometimes things change and your dumb old thoughts need to be buried so you can just move on and be you. Sometimes things that seemed so big and important for so long, aren't, actually. Sometimes it's nice to just reconcile with your past self and say, "You know what? Get out of the way. I know better now. Also quit being so fucking serious about shit that doesn't matter. You're making other people miserable. Grow up."

Grow up. Pierce your nose.[^2] Have fun. It's all passing by so quickly and the more you try and dig in and plan out and dress down and build up this idea of how you need to be, the more of yourself you leave scattered in your wake until you're nothing but a bunch of thoughts that no one needs to hear.
