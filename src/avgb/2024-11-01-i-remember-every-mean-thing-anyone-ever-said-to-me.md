Annie posted [another blogging challenge](https://weblogpomo.club/challenges). For November, she suggested doing AMA-inspired posts. AMA. Ask Me Anything. I love it. I wanna do it. I put out the call on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@keenan/113405189108547666), but if you have interesting questions you'd like me to answer, <a href="mailto:keenan@gkeenan.co?subject=Hello, I have an AMA question for you">send them my way</a>. I'll answer my favorites throughout the month.

The first question I got was from Annie. Different Annie.[^1]

I'm not a Halloween person. However, I *am* a disordered thinking person, so I was excited to consider question number one. And, honestly, it wasn't particularly hard to narrow it down.

If there is one internal pattern I could change about myself right this second, it would be I WANT TO STOP THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THE MEAN THINGS PEOPLE HAVE SAID TO ME OVER THE YEARS.

It's excruciating, how much braintime this shit takes up. If I can't sleep. If I'm playing a video game. If I'm driving around in the car. They're there. Gnawing away. The little seeds of self-doubt and criticism and all of the times people made fun of me for being fat or ugly or like I have a little tiny bit of a lisp even though other people disagree and don't hear it BUT NOW I HEAR IT. I HEAR IT. 

I try so hard to navigate life being as kind as possible to people, and so when, inevitably, someone doesn't *vibe with that,* it cuts so, so deep. I wonder every single day if today will be the day where I wake up and magically stop giving a shit, like so many adults told me they did once they got old, but *I AM OLD NOW AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET. WHERE IS MY TREAT??*

And if I were to get hyper-specific about it all, I'd want to obliterate the mean things that were said specifically by people who suck shit and who are awful and who don't matter. People I would never want to associate with in the first place! Like my former colleagues who were talking shit about me behind my back in the Sprout Social alumni Slack. Who does that? Shitty people who suck and who I shouldn't care about, *but I fucking care,* and I wish more than anything that I could just stop. Those thoughts (and, let's be fair, those people) can get fucked and also fuck off.

Deeeeeep breath.

Not for Halloween, but one time in elementary school we had to give presentations on a famous historical figure *and* we had to dress up like them. I was obsessed with *Mr. Holland's Opus* at the time, which implanted the idea that I wanted to do my report on Billie Holiday. When I chose this person, I did not realize she was a woman, but when I found out, I was all in. My mom and I went dress shopping at a local theater costume store. I got a really nice red sequined getup, black gloves, a little black feathery hat thing—real 1930s vibes happening—and I wore the shit out of that outfit in front of my whole class while I gave my report and my teacher applauded me for my bravery.[^2]

Also, my mother thankfully had the good goddamned sense not to put me in blackface. Win-win all around.
