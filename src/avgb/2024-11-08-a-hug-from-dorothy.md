In college, I was a Fiction Writing major. I wouldn't say this was, like, the smartest decision I ever made in life, but I had spent literal years farting around in art school[^1], jumping from major to major to major until I finally, *mercifully* settled on the one that would be printed on my degree. Fiction Writing wasn't accompanied by a ton of perks. It wasn't one of the mysterious and super Bohemian ones, like... Fashion Design, or something... I dunno, which one of you got showered in copious amounts of sex? That wasn't me.

I did get to see a lot of writers read, though. That was a part of the work, and it was awesome. Henry Rollins yelling, *so much yelling!* into an auditorium full of captivated young adults. Irvine Welsh reading in his thick brogue as we packed the Metro theater. Some of the writers were also our instructors! Nami Mun. Joe Meno. Randy Albers. We were surrounded by talent.

But so many years later, the one event that stands out to me the most was seeing Dorothy Allison. Our instructor, Megan Stielstra, took our class to one of the common areas that had been set up with rows of those stacking chairs. The ones made of metal, with their concave plastic backs and seats. I sat with my other classmates, clutched my copy of *Bastard Out of Carolina,* and I listened. Listened as Dorothy read a story about perseverance, about bravery, about fighting against everything that is telling you to minimize yourself. To scrape by, to survive. To overcome.

I'm racking my brain, trying to figure out what she was reading from, almost 20 years later. I hardly remember the words, it's been so long. But I remember how she captivated me with her emotion, how she read in her lovely drawl, how her intensity radiated from the page, from her eyes on the stage. There was a moment where I lost myself, thinking she was specifically reading to me. About me. There I was, alone in the audience, surviving by the grace of her warmth and hope.

Until it was over. We were clapping. We were standing. We were lining up to say hello and have her sign our books. My friend, Tiffany, was looking through her bag when she realized she had left her copy at home. I told her she could have mine. Megan promised she would find a way to get me a signed copy, but I told her that was okay. The autograph wasn't important to me.

Instead, I inched forward in line as Dorothy greeted those in front of me, until I finally stood towering over her. She smiled from behind her huge glasses and said hello. 

And with tears in my eyes, I asked her, "Can I have a hug?" *Like a fucking psychopath.* Who just asks a random stranger—nay! A renowned author!—for a hug in front of, like, I dunno, a hundred other people who just want their books signed??

Me. I am that psychopath.

And without skipping a beat, she said, "Of course!" And she threw her arms around me.

It was like she knew. She saw a quiet little queer kid trying their best to figure everything out. And she knew. It's the love of others that gets us through.

[Dorothy died this week](https://mailchi.mp/sinisterwisdom/dorothyallison?e=907ddb10c6). I met her once, briefly, decades ago. 

All of her struggle and her bravery and her warmth, I can still feel it wrapped around me.

Buck up, kid. You've got no other choice than to make it through this life.
