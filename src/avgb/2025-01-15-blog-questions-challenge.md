title: I wasn't going to get super meta on here, but the people clamour for more Keenan and who am I to deny them their simple pleasures?

Because both [Jarrod](https://heydingus.net/blog/2025/1/blog-questions-challenge) and [Robb](https://rknight.me/blog/blog-question-challenge/) asked so nicely, and (mostly) because I've been feeling super self-conscious about not publishing anything[^1], here are my answers to this little blog questions challenge that has been circling the Independent World Wide Web.

Hopefully, the rush of publishing this will spark an introspective reckoning that finally leads to my inevitable takeover of the literary world, or maybe I'll just go play more Path of Exile 2.

***Why did you start blogging in the first place?***

I've got a compulsion, I dunno. For as far back as my brain will allow me to venture, I've wanted to be a writer. This has manifested in myriad ways over the years, but my obsession with digitally rendering my words began when my parents bought a Compaq Presario back in the mid-90s and I began slapping my fingies on its keyboard.

Initially, I was drawn to a very special program called [Echo Lake](http://www.kevinsteele.com/mackerel_el_gallery.html), which was a word processor wrapped up in the cozy veneer of a simulated log cabin on a lake—what the kids today might describe as "cottage core"—a UI so devoted to the concept of skeuomorphism[^2] that it's almost as if the designers were time-travelers whose interdimensional vehicles were somehow rendered inoperable and the only thing they could think of to save our timeline (and themselves) from its inevitable collapse was to make Jony Ive spontaneously combust at some indeterminate future point. Unfortunately, as of this moment, they appear to have failed and I think that explains a lot about the world.

Anyway, the inherent contradiction of being someone who is deeply introverted but also desperate for human connection eventually led me to seek solace in the Internet.

The first "blog" I recall making was a uJournal, followed by a couple LiveJournals. They were, essentially, places where I could drop the E.E. Cummings-inspired poetry (such as my magnum opus, "The Cheese," written under my pen name, Foetus) of my teenage years, as well as, of course, the inane ramblings inherent to a public diary you keep when your brain hasn't fully developed.

Years later, I would discover Squarespace, where I kept a number of blogs. One was ostensibly a more adult[^3] version of my earlier LiveJournal efforts, but was mostly just a place where I would write reviews of media. Another was an Apple-focused tech blog, something the world had never before seen. It was wildly popular. I was super famous. I loved every minute of it and I absolutely did not have an existential crisis the first time John Gruber linked to me and introduced me to traffic that exceeded five whole digits. Eventually, ennui led to that blog's demise. I was tired of chasing analytics. I was tired of writing about fucking technology. I was tired of maintaining a temple devoted to an identity that didn't even feel like my own.

Years later, I'd spin up A Very Good Blog because I realized I needed to write again. But I wanted a blog where I didn't feel beholden to some prior brand or niche or expectation other than me just having an idea and writing about it.[^4] 

***What platform are you using to manage your blog, and why do you use it?***

Having finally freed myself from Squarespace's very weak little grasp, my site is now built with Eleventy. I use it because of peer pressure. I had to teach myself HTML and CSS to hand-code much of it. For the rest, I hand-copy-and-pasted from people I respect (Robb).

In all seriousness, it feels good to have a site that feels a bit finicky to maintain, where I can live out my little fantasy of starring in the movie *Hackers*. There's something really sexy to me about not having a CMS and, instead, just writing Markdown files and putting them in a folder, and then watching the code I wrote magically transform them into words with style. I enjoy writing Diet Code™ and being able to imagine what the words will look like when published on the site. It's like looking into the Matrix, but for a moron.

***How do you write your posts?***

I haven't quite finished my Udemy crash course on Neuroscience, so some of the following details may be inaccurate. However, my understanding is that my brain (what I lovingly refer to as my "thought pot") sends some electrical signals to my muscles, which elicit a little tippy-tap dance from my finger atop my keyboard.[^5] All of this is improbably coordinated and somehow results in sentences that are strung together in a mostly coherent manner.

The receptacle for these improbabilities is called iA Writer. I start a new document, paste some front matter, and then let my brain dump. I like iA Writer for its minimalism. I like iA Writer because it syncs my library to the cloud, so if I'm feeling especially stupid, I can write a couple sentences on my iPhone until I get so annoyed with it that I run back to my PC and finish writing the thought there. I like iA Writer because my blog's library is saved as a local folder in the iA Writer interface, so when I'm ready to publish, I just save a copy of the document to that local folder. Then I open up VS Code to push it off to GitHub, which then, not all that dissimilarly to a muscle contraction, gets thrust off to Netlify.

Oh, also, I read my writing out loud while I write. I'll read sentences and paragraphs with different tone and intonation and speed. I like hearing how everything sounds strung together, and where the flow gets interrupted by a weird word choice, so I can find a different way to express the same feeling. It also helps me identify grammatical errors or typos. It's a great way to edit, and it just so happens to be terrific practice in the off chance I decided to record the piece for the [audioblog](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-very-good-audio-blog/id1724269695).

***When do you feel most inspired to write?***

Wow, this questionnaire should've come with a trigger warning. 

Inspiration and I have a tumultuous relationship, and for the longest time, I would only write when I felt "inspired," as though if I wasn't called upon by some nebulous muse, then I didn't mean the words enough. This led to periods of my life where I let literal years pass by between writing anything creatively. 

I try to fight that affliction every day. I frequently lose.

To that end, it's hard for me to pin down what/when/why/how I feel inspired to write. Sometimes it's something that annoyed me. Sometimes someone mentions something in Discord that awakens a latent beast. Sometimes I think about songs I like. Sometimes I really just need to unpack some trauma. Sometimes I drink a Mountain Dew that sucks so bad.

There's no rhyme or reason, and I am slowly, but surely learning that sometimes, many times, oftentimes inspiration can kick rocks and I just need to sit my ass down and write words and that's enough. I'm sure I'll keep telling myself that last bit until the end of time, but it's hard to deny that it *works, you dumb bitch. Just fucking write. Quit being such a baby about it.*

***Do you normally publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit?***

It really depends on how much I cried while writing it. If it took a lot out of me to get it on the page, I'll often let it simmer, maybe get some other eyes on it. Come back to it later to rework parts, if necessary. I'm getting better about being patient. 

If it's something that doesn't feel particularly serious, like, say, this fucking thing you're reading right now, I'll probably do a final pass to make sure I don't have any glaring errors (or: "glerrors") and then publish it. I'm getting better about accepting when something is good enough.

***What's your favorite post on your blog?***

I dunno. They're all my babies, don't make me choose. Okay, [not you](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/i-do-not-enjoy-the-saxophone-but-it-is-not-impossible-to-surprise-me/). Or [you](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/i-dont-want-a-folding-phone-but-i-dont-not-want-a-folding-phone/).

Okay, fine, gun to my head, it's probably my [essay about my cousin](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/ive-missed-sam-for-a-very-long-time-or-pick-your-battles/). It's very emotional. It took forever to write (most of which was spent just reminiscing and trying to understand what I felt and why), and the end result is vastly different than what my original vision was. I'm extremely proud of it.

For something that probably won't make you cry while you listen to it in the grocery store, I like this very normal piece [I wrote about RSS readers](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/rss-readers-make-me-want-to-jump-into-a-vat-of-acid/).

***Any future plans for the blog?***

No. I just want to make people laugh and cry and feel things. As long as that is true, I will keep this shit up.

***Who will participate next?***

I want to hear from Molly White and Britt. One of them doesn't even *have* a blog, as far as I am aware, but this is me manifesting. Make it happen, World Wide Weblog Jesus.

[^1]: In no small part due to the fact that after the results of the stupid fucking election in the U.S., I've been feeling pretty down and miserable about things, so I've retreated into whatever escapist bullshit I can to hold onto my sanity, even though I know full well that I would probably feel a lot better if, instead of just sitting with all of my stupid thoughts, I put a bit of effort into getting something down onto the page, because it almost *always* makes me feel better. Me and ignoring my what is in my own self-interest—name a more iconic duo.

[^2]: Seriously, one of the wildest features of this thing was when you created a new document, it essentially bound a new "book" for you to write in. The more documents you created, the more books populated the digital bookshelf, and to open a document, you selected it from the shelf and it slid out and unfurled its pages before you. I thought this was so mature and official that the first document I created in Echo Lake was titled "The Journey of Death," which I envisioned being a multi-volume series where I ruminated about humanity's relationship to mortality, what the afterlife was like, etc. I was nine.

[^3]: "Adult" like *grown up*, not like *porn*. But feel free to subscribe to my [OnlyFans](https://ko-fi.com/gkeenan).

[^4]: Ironically, if you go back in the archive, you might notice that some of my first posts I wrote here are your typical tech link blog fodder, lmao why am I like this.

[^5]: You ever think about how fucked up it is that you're basically a sack of water, meat, and bones that move because your thought pot sends invisible orders to contract and relax your muscles to varying levels of precision? It's weird! Like thinking about breathing. Like thinking about blinking. You're welcome.
