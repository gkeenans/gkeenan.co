***Update—01/28/2025: I know the writing on my site often oscillates between earnest and absurd, but for this post, please know that this is coming from a place of absolute sincerity.***

***I have removed the piece that was originally posted here. A dear friend reached out to let me know that, despite any humorous or satirical intent I had in writing it, the way I chose to end it caused them very real harm. It horrified me to hear that—made all the more horrifying by the fact that I didn't think to consider the ramifications of how my writing, divorced of the context of a very specific moment in time, would affect people.***

***I fucked up, plain and simple. I am truly sorry to anyone I hurt with the words I chose, and I absolutely understand why you'd be hurt by them. I feel ashamed that my ignorance prevented me from considering that prior to publishing.***

***Whatever satirical goal I was trying to achieve is irrelevant. The stakes of our current reality are too high for me to be careless—and wielding the words that symbolize the pain and suffering of so many was exactly that. There are plenty of people worth targeting with our ire right now, and I want to do that, but not at the expense of the well-being of those I care about.***

***I don't think trying to contextualize the moment or explain my thought process further is appropriate here, but if you have additional questions or anything you'd like to discuss with me, I would be more than happy to converse [via email](mailto:keenan@gkeenan.co).***

***I appreciate those who reached out to tell me that I messed up. I will do everything I can to be more considerate of how my words and actions could impact others going forward.***
