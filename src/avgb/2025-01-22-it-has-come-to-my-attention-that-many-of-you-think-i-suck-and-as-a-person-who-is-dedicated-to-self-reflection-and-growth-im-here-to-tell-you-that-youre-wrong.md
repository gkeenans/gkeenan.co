Over the past 72 hours, I have been the subject of scorn and ridicule the likes of which have never before been seen on the Internet. Up until this point, I have basked in the warm praise of web stardom, soaking up the well-earned reverence and clout bestowed upon me as the developer of a lot of people's favorite app.

But, oh, how quickly things change. 

Now, even Jesus would look over at me as he lazed about on his cross and say, "Rough day, huh?"

It all started when *someone* personally attacked me by referencing my actual words and/or actions. 

I know! Like, *excuse me? Do you know who I am?* 

How dare you tell me that something I did hurt you or someone you care about in some way? How could you even imply that through my direct action—or inaction—I somehow caused emotional and/or physical harm? Frankly, I am offended that you're even allowed to directly reference the things I have definitely said and/or done—as well as reference the people I voluntarily choose to associate myself with—and somehow extrapolate my thoughts and/or opinions as a result. 

To be scrutinized so thoroughly and unjustly is something I truly would not wish upon my worst enemy, who I believe more than anything I can win over with civility. You should try it!

That's the problem with you people, though. You can't be reasoned with. You're so focused on trying to make me feel bad by telling me how I hurt you and expecting me—*me!*—to atone. For *what* exactly? For *being a good guy?* For working hard every day? 

You know, it's a real shame that you want to tear me down when we share much of the same goals. Don't you care about that? Or do you just want to see me destroyed? And if that happens, what then? Where else will people go for app?? You're so obsessed with sullying my reputation, and *for what??* Because I performed an action that is in direct conflict with the persona I otherwise display for the world to see?

What about the feelings I feel? What about the values and morals I hold that quietly guide me to the choices I make every single day? Do you even care? Why won't you take all of that into account?

No, I won't tell you what any of those are. I'm trying to take the temperature down here, and the last thing I need is for you to try and hold me accountable when I inevitably fail to live up to the expectations I myself set.

It's just such a shame that you won't even give me the benefit of the doubt, the thing I've been accustomed to having for a very long time and am suddenly being robbed of due to the decisions I have made, the words I have said, and the supposed wrongs I would rather not directly address!

Honestly, if you really wanted me to listen to you, you should've figured out a better way to address this. Publicly referencing things I have said or done *in public* is, frankly, pretty disgusting behavior on your part. How can I possibly learn to be a better person if other people are watching? That's a thing I need to do in solitude, where only I can set the parameters necessary for me to declare that I have spent the time and thought required to undergo such growth. 

Anyway, I choose to seek solace in those still willing to heap praise upon me.  Clearly, I have done nothing wrong. Why else would these people who are weirdly attached to me and my every move feel compelled to defend me and not consider alternative perspectives for even a second? It is perfectly reasonable and normal!

I have to mute you now. The tone you're taking is too heated. So screechy! I can't stand to listen to it anymore, even though I have done absolutely nothing you have asked of me to try and resolve the situation. I hate that it has come to this, but it's just impossible to talk to anyone who would operate in such bad faith. 

My heart is pure. My conscience is clear.

*Sieg Heil!*
