After months of deliberately denying myself a daily coffee due to tummy reasons, I have recently ventured back into the realm of making my morning bean juice. Prior to the aforementioned tummy reasons, I would make a batch of cold brew that lasted me a few days. Now, I find myself—shockingly![^1]—sticking to the classic pourover method, and after tireless experimentation, I've developed a routine that is not only soothing in the way that rituals can be, but also consistently produces some of the best cups of coffee I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. 

I thought it would be unfair to withhold this knowledge any longer, so here is how I make the perfect cup of pourover coffee.

### Tools

For this method, I rely on the following:
- [OXO Conical Burr Coffee Grinder (black)](https://www.oxo.com/conical-burr-coffee-grinder.html)
- [Fellow Atmos Vacuum Canister (black)](https://fellowproducts.com/products/atmos-vacuum-canister?variant=18635552227443)
- [Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Kettle (black)](https://fellowproducts.com/products/stagg-ekg-electric-pour-over-kettle)
- [Chemex (original wood, original brown)](https://chemexcoffeemaker.com/products/six-cup-classic-chemex)
- [Barista Warrior Reusable Pour Over Coffee Filter for Chemex and Hario V60 (gold)](https://baristawarrior.com/collections/filters/products/titanium-gold-coated-pour-over-coffee-filter)

I (mostly) love these tools (the coffee grinder and vacuum canister are *fine*), but I recognize that when it comes down to it, the most important elements for making the perfect cup of coffee come down to...

### Ingredients

A truly terrific cup of coffee is contingent on two things: 
1. Great beans 
2. Great water

We buy our beans from Sightglass. They offer a [seasonal subscription](https://sightglasscoffee.com/products/seasonal?variant=29178362101875), so we're almost always delighted by a blend from a new location. Each bag ships directly to us on a timeline we specify and comes labeled with the country of origin, as well as the tasting notes to expect. There are few things more exciting to me and my wife than receiving a new bag of coffee so we can open it up and get that first smell. We lead a simple, boring life and this small moment of joy is something we look forward to every few weeks. It makes the walk to the mailbox worth it.

The water is, admittedly, a bit harder to replicate, but is an absolutely crucial element. Ours is sourced from a spring tucked away in a small clearing in the trees at the back of our 80 acre farm. One day, I was walking the dog and she managed to slip out of her collar, darting away in hot pursuit of a squirrel. To my dismay, she refused to listen to my cries, and quickly disappeared into the forest. I chased after her, toiling with panic and dread, only to find her in the clearing, front paw up, hackles raised, staring at cat. 

The cat, long and lithe, shiny black fur glistening in the sun, sat before us, unbothered by my dog. Instead, she turned her gaze to me and I was immediately filled with a deep warmth, as though the rays of the sun emanated from within, rather than peppering my pale flesh from an unfathomable cosmic gap. The dread I had felt just a moment before was rendered a distant memory.

"Oh!" I said.

To which the cat replied, "So you see."

"You can talk?"

She nodded.

"What's your name?" I asked her.

"I am," she said, and then gestured with a gentle glance to the clear water bubbling from a spring within a circle of meticulously-placed smooth rocks. "So you see."

I had never seen water so clear, so pure. It gently rose from the Earth and cascaded down back on itself. Its quiet burble beckoned. 

I knelt down, brought my mouth to the water, and drank. 

The cat placed her little toe beans on the top of my head. "For you are now a Chosen," she said. "A Forever Person. A mere glimmer in the Cosmos, and yet an entire Universe all the same. We are one. We are."

I swallowed the water. Felt it course through my body. The cold comforted my throat and my stomach and my veins and my heart, the wisdom of millennia infused in sweet nectar. At once, I became peace.

"We return when we thirst for knowledge," she said. She turned to glide away, as fluid as the spring itself, before pausing. She looked back. 

"Bring fish," she said.

I nodded, and when I returned the next day I brought fish as she asked. We drank from the spring. We talked for hours. We laughed. We basked in the warmth we gave back to the Sun. We explored the past, the future, the path of enlightenment tangled up in a web of entropy spanning many, many years. We were one.

Centuries later, I still return to the spring to see my friend. I bring her fish. Me and I am. We are. A beautiful secret for us to share, the magic of the spring. The water that gives us life and lets us live.

And it brews terrific coffee.

### Method

I use [this recipe](https://socal.coffee/recipes/chemex/). I like that it automatically adjusts the measurements based on how many grams of coffee I'm using. It's nifty.

### Fin

That's it! Everything you need to make a purrfect cup of a coffee. A ritual of love I have labored over for as long as time. I hope it helps.

May your bean juice bring you joy.

[^1]: I say shockingly because I just simply do not enjoy a warm beverage. I have always, always gravitated toward cold drinks, and if it weren't for the sheer convenience of making two cups of coffee each morning (one for me, one for my wife), I probably would not disregard my thirst for a brisk brew with such aplomb.
