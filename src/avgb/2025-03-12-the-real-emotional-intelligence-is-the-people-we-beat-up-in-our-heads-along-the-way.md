Well this is fucking embarrassing to admit, but here we go: there was a period of time in my mid-to-late-20s or so where I would fantasize[^1] about getting into fights. Physical fights. Not, like, random arguments, no, there were *plenty* of those. I was no stranger to verbal sparring. My first marriage was super healthy!

I'm talkin' *fights.* Fisticuffs. Punchy, kicky, oh god is that a knife?? Blood blood. The sort of spontaneous brawl that we may witness in a film when we need to be shown that our hero is actually a secret badass on a quest for justice. And as someone  admittedly *obsessed* with justice, this was one of the ways that obsession manifested.[^2] 

The scenario was, invariably, as follows: I'd be walking on the sidewalk or down an alley—I lived in Chicago, a city absolutely *littered* with alleys, because where else would you put your trash[^3]—minding my own business, and some fuckin' fool(s) would start shit and I would, miraculously, persevere, fending off my adversaries with a series of dodges and dips and ducks and dives and dodges, followed by a jab to the kidney, a trip, a flip, and a quick tip of the toe to the temple. I dunno what the hell a haymaker is, but I had one of those, too, wound up and ready to go for the jamoke who had the gall to get back up for more. If need be, I could also grab him by the shirt collar and ram his head into a dumpster and then, finally, stomp his ass until his fingers stopped twitching. 

You know... Justice! 

And, naturally, in this fantasy, I would emerge unscathed—physically *and* emotionally—because I suppose a secret Batman lived deep within me, ready to step in and commandeer my body to complete his dark objective when it was needed the most: in the unlikely event I became embroiled in a physical altercation.

Because, like, let's be real for second? I've never been punched. Never thrown one. And if I was ever involved in a situation where either of those things happened, I would *probably fucking die.* I'm not being self-deprecating for comedic effect. I think anyone who has ever met me would put money on *literally anyone else* winning a fist fight in which I was involved.

It's honestly something that I still find particularly baffling about me, considering how so much of my consciousness is dedicated to coping with anxiety as it constantly yells at me about all of the horrible ways I'm going to die. My tummy hurts. Cancer. My back hurts. Cancer. My poop weird. Cancer. Flying in a plane? Crash. 

My mom recently joked that I'll probably live until I'm 90, worrying that I am going to die every day. Which, like, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Very funny and also fuck you.

But getting jumped in a dark alley? Somehow, in that scenario, my brain thought I'd come out on top. Out of shape. No training. Just pure instinct and a will to survive (and I guess all of the cool fighting moves I learned playing video games??) would be enough to carry me to victory.

I would like to reiterate that these were the thoughts of a younger, dumber person. I don't experience them anymore; my fighting days are far behind me. But I was rendered momentarily incapacitated earlier today when I had a brief flashback to my younger self, reminiscing about how I *used* to think about these things, and, like, *what the fuck was that all about, ya weirdo???*

And while I have to imagine that some of it was partly mid-20s feelings of invulnerability getting super cozy with a propensity for catastrophizing, I think the more likely culprit was that I just didn't have a healthy emotional outlet during much of my teenage years into young adulthood. Growing up, it often felt like I was the only person in my family who was actively shamed for experiencing heightened emotions. And that was a trend that carried on into my late teens through my early-30s, when I was in a relationship with someone who didn't have much patience for me when I wasn't actively reigning myself in. My excitement could get annoying. My joking too embarrassing. My anger, something to tuck away. It led to me feeling, a lot of the time, that I had to suppress my emotions for the sake of those around me. That the last thing I should ever be for anyone was *too much.*

If you're thinking, "Oh, no, Keenan, that sounds like a recipe for a self-perpetuating cycle of outbursts of rage followed by immense shame that then slowly bubbles up into yet more rage!" Uh, yeah, you're right![^4] It was a bad time! It's extremely difficult to know what to do with yourself in those moments. When you're grasping for any semblance of control. When you're desperate to feel like your anger is justified. When all you need, more than anything, is an outlet.

Actually, I wonder if that's what drives people to take up things like boxing? Just thinking out loud here. I dunno! I'm sure it's way more complex and unique to each individual. I don't want to oversimplify something I know next to nothing about. Regardless, I never really considered real combat as an option. I was always too scared of getting hurt. That's why I fought people in my brain, where I was impervious, and adept, and, you know, *super attractive.* In what situation could I be any more justified to experience *big feelings* than when some (imaginary) dickhead(s) decided to roll up and try to (imaginary) kill me (in my head)? These were scenarios tailor-made for me to feel self-righteous, justified, in my anger.

Looking back, I recognize that these fantasies largely subsided as I was able to take the time to work on me, to come to terms with how I experience anger and rage, which, in turn, made it easier to experience unpleasant emotions, to sit with them, rather than force them to simmer under closed lid until everything eventually exploded and there was no hope of reigning them in.

A lot of my insecurity and doubt and anger and frustration with myself dissipated when I didn't have to pretend like those feelings didn't exist. And when I'm not shaming myself into submission because of them, they don't have the same power over me. I can recognize them. I can experience them. And I can let them pass, like any other feeling. They're not gone, by any means, but they don't take hold of me, like secret Batman, and control me the way they used to. As a result, I've had to fight my thoughts a hell of a lot less, which is really all I could ever ask for.

I dunno, y'all. Therapy is great, don't get me wrong. But it's also worthwhile checking in and seeing if you spend a significant amount of time trying to appease those around you. How much of yourself are you sacrificing for their sake? Is it worth beating yourself into a pulp so you fit into their world?

[^1]: Fantasize? Is that the right word? I dunno. It's not like I was lusting after it. I wasn't, y'know, secretly horny for this little brain deviation to come to fruition. I know that a fantasy isn't inherently a sex thing, duh, I've imagined winning the lottery, but, like, this one feels horny-adjacent? But it *wasn't,* is the thing. This wasn't a Henry Caville throwing me around a bathroom situation, which, for the record, I would *love.*

[^2]: The other way was winning every single argument I ever had in my head.

[^3]: ANY THOUGHTS, NEW YORK CITY???

[^4]: Are you a licensed therapist? What insurance do you take??
