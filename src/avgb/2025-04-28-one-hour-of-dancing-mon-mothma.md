Today, I sat in front of this stupid dumb iA Writer window and stared with utter contempt at this gorgeous light blue cursor for what felt like three fucking hours, and by the time I closed the window, it had left but two paragraphs in its wake, one great and one a true monstrosity. It's in these moments that I question why I try to write anything at all. I question what I have to say. I question my existence. And if it sounds like we're veering hard into *wow, Keenan, that feels, I dunno, maybe ***slightly hyperbolic*** territory*â€”YEAH, OKAY, I AM ALLOWED TO HAVE MY FEELINGS.

I don't know of a better, non-super-reductive way to say it: shit's been bleak, fam. I know it. I've felt it. Felt the byproduct of it daily. Sequestered myself away. Made myself smaller. Made my world... smaller. Hoped for reprieve. Set my sights on what I can do about the future, in the future, when everything big doesn't feel so big, like that's a thing that ever even happens. On good days, my creative output felt tumultuous at best, and the days don't feel particularly good right now. Navigating The Internet the past few months feels like walking on eggshells in a minefield. I wish the people who felt so determined to share in the collective agony understood how much it hurts to trip and have the explosion of anxiety wash over. I wish they understood that *the news still finds me*. I don't need any more! Really! 

But it's not my place to say.

I used to have such an appetite for The Fight. Hours in the trenches of Facebook and Twitter. Novels worth of words published perfectly[^1] articulating my stances. Hours of rumination and anxiety following. None of it moving the needle. None of it making me feel better. Tricking myself into chasing a resolution that never came. What glimpses I see of it now, I recoil. I can't subject myself to it. Being loud and right and loudly right. What did it ever get me?

If not The Fight, then what? What good am I? Do I relent? Let it envelop me? Breathe it in? Soak it up? Suck it down? Lose myself and everything good I've tried to find in me? Would it be worth it to burn with righteous indignation?

If not The Fight, then what? Is that what we need? More ire? More anger? More fury? More pain and anxiety and the pursuit of illusory catharsis? What is it that will finally soothe?

If not The Fight, then who am I? What purpose do I serve? Why waste my time? Why kid myself? Why worry? Why push?

Meandering through the pages here, my dismay over what little I've had to say lately hangs over me. A noxious undulating cloud, darkening and darkening. It's impossible to ignore, and I wonder if it might be better to let it win. I've already let everyone down. *I've already let everyone down? Get over yourself, dickwad.* Who reads this shit anyway?

*Someone, perhaps. Someone who hadn't the day before. Someone who was a stranger before they told you they had. An apparition coalescing into a person. Someone who doesn't realize their words would mean as much as they did when they tell you that what you made meant something ***to them***.*

*And now, an irrevocable connection. What you did mattered.*

If not the fight, then what is The Fight? How do we win? What do we do? What other purpose do we have?

The Fight isn't merely fury. The Fight is opposition, and opposition is creating what they don't have. Cultivating quiet. Taking space. Making peace. Relishing in the most importance aspects of our humanity, our love for each other, our creativity manifest. In what ways do you defy expectation? In what ways do you express yourself? 

How do you bring that out in others? Share the light. Champion their curiosity. Praise their bravery. Listen. Listen. Listen.

Be vulnerable. Let them see. Let them take it all in. Find the ones that connect and hold onto them. You've just made your world larger. You've just made yourself larger. You've just ensured that even when you're gone, you're not.
