title: Today, I am writing about a fork and, no, it's not a metaphor for anything please stop asking

I have held off writing about this, but I don't think I can, in good conscience, sit with this dark secret any longer: I don't name my forks. This is a fact that exists despite my growing up constantly bombarded by the classic adage, "A named fork tines times."[^1] Is there any axiom more significant to modern society? If so, I am not familiar with it. 

I understand the above admission might elicit strong feelings from deep within. You may even feel so compelled to reach out and try to convince me of the error of my ways, and I beg you: please do not do that. I have been chastised enough over the years for my willful disregard of cultural norms.

My grandparents were adamant. "Name your forks," they said. "Don't make the same mistakes I did." They died rich and happy, and, look, I fully understand the problems inherent to anonymous utensils, but I have been—likely always will be—someone who ardently opposes tradition. I am quietly rebellious by nature, and so sometimes I (often subconsciously) disregard sage advice in an effort to fully own my reality. "Paddle your own boat, before your boat paddles you," like my spoons say. I listen to them. Sometimes I wonder if their little bowls serve a purpose other than storing wisdom and milk.

Now, I'm not completely heartless. I still appreciate the utility of a fork. I still, you know, marvel at its gentle curvature. The spacing between the little pokeys where my food sits. I like that they stab okay and scoop okay. They are versatile, there's no denying. I'm not a monster. I do have love in my heart.

Example: when I was doing the dishes the other day, I was once again drawn to our most, hmm, *enthusiastic* fork. A special lil' guy whose head curves with such severity, I have to wonder what force on Earth could've possibly bent it. While its siblings are all unique in their own stupid ways, none of them manage to exhibit flexibility the way that this one, in particular, does. To use this fork is to render your arm into a meat backhoe, shoveling from plate to gullet. Take care whilst chomping, for it is perfectly shaped to stab your soft palate. There's no gentle way to say it: that would fucking hurt. It's a curious little inhabitant of our kitchen, this fork. I often catch myself marveling at it. How did you get this way? Why don't I dare try to bend you back? 

You seem so *happy.*

If I *were* to name it, I would go with "Curvy," because of how it is.[^2] But I have committed so long to not carrying on the wisdom of my elders, and I don't think I can bring myself to deviate now. And, in fairness, my elders were responsible for Ronald Reagan, so I don't think I'm way off base here.

But with that defiance comes wonder. Is there a life I miss by purposely avoiding what's in front of me? Does this conviction serve me beyond the personal satisfaction of adhering to some sick, spiteful dogma? I gain nothing by insisting, and yet I can't not.

This itty bendy boi. Just happy to be here. It beckons, little fingies curled, granting wishes without condition. A small pal here to feed. It is not a metaphor; it is a fork. A fork I got from a friend in the midst of my divorce. Now it is bent—which is a statement I make without full knowledge of the sequence of events that led to its current shape. I did not immediately scrutinize the uniformity of my newfound fork family upon its bestowal, which would've been rude. I accepted the generosity with grace, like a well-adjusted person does when they receive free silverware. It is only in recent years, as I become more acquainted, that I notice its idiosyncratic appearance.

And I imagine its life with us ends here. One day, sometime soon, we will replace it. But for the time being, I will smile when I pull it from the dishwasher. 

Are you different this time? Tell me. I didn't think to measure you.

They cast a light shadow to the right. The forks sit nestled in one another, which only accentuates just how drastic the right's curve is compared to the left's. They do not fit, but they are a pair.](https://avgb.b-cdn.net/img/forks.jpg)
