The moviefilm *Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997, and remained in theaters for 54 consecutive weeks following its initial release. For 15 weekends, it was the number one film at the box office. These are just fun facts.

More fun facts:

- When *Titanic* released in December of 1997, I was 11 years-old.
- Between the ages of 11 and 12, I saw *Titanic* in the theater a total of six times.
- I cried *every single time*.

At some point in 1998—I'm pretty sure after 7th grade started—I asked a girl out for the first time. Her name was Jordan. Actually, for legal reasons, let's say her name was Whitney. Forget I said Jordan. Erase that. Think about a banana or something. Walk through a doorway. What color was your first car?

I asked Whitney out after weeks of meekly dancing around the subject with a litany of insinuations in nightly chats on AOL. In the midst of asking very sly and clever questions such as, "Do you have a crush on anyone at school?" or, "Would you ever go out with anyone at school?" and writing subtle Away Messages that implied I was thinking about someone special (I wasn't yet cool enough to listen to music whose lyrics I could use to accurately convey the desperate yearning I experienced), I eventually built up the confidence to pop the question. Which, for an unbearably shy and introverted kid, was one of the most pivotal, momentous occasions I can recall from my childhood.[^1]

Here is a semi-accurate reenactment:

`AlienF321: Can I ask you a question?`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: sure`
`AlienF321: Guess what?`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: wut`
`AlienF321: Chicken butt!!`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: lol`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: r u serious`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: is that ur question`
`AlienF321: LoL`
`AlienF321: No.`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: lol wut was it`
`AlienF321: Did you do your homework for Language Arts?`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: srsly??`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: i dont believe u`
`AlienF321: What?`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: thats not ur question!`
`AlienF321: Okay okay.`
`AlienF321: I don't know why this feels so hard to ask.`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: omg wut is it?`
`AlienF321: I dunno. I just feel emberrased.`
`WhitneyHunneyBear: just ask`
`AlienF321: Okay fine.`
`AlienF321: Would you want to, like, be boyfriend and girlfriend?`
**AlienF321 signed off at 9:17:36 PM.**

Despite my attempt to poof the consequences of my question out of existence by immediately signing out and pretending I hadn't actually asked it, the next time I logged into AOL, I was greeted by a ***YOU'VE GOT MAIL!*** An email from Whitney that said, essentially, "Sure."

Thus began our months-long whirlwind romance that was punctuated by: 
- The one time we held hands at Funway, which we were essentially forced to because the DJ at the roller rink said that everyone skating during the couple's skate needed to or they weren't allowed to skate anymore.[^2]
- The one time we walked around downtown Geneva, IL (no hand holding). I spent the whole walk trying to decide how I should give her the gift[^3] I secreted away in the pocket of my JNCO shorts. In the end, I decided to wait until we were about to part ways, at which point I awkwardly said, "Uh, hey," and handed it to her and then turned around and walked away.
- The nearly daily ritual of chasing my dickhead friend, Noel, around the school parking lot during lunch because he kept making fun of me for having a girlfriend.[^4]

Despite being IRL boyfriendgirlfriend, Whitney and I mostly interacted with each other online, where we could chat for hours in the solitude of our instant messenger window. We talked about kids at school, and teachers at school, and classes at school. I told her, "I like you." She told me, "I like you, too." We were 12.

I told her about how I had seen *Titanic* in the theater five times and she said she thought that was impressive. I said I wanted to see it again, and she said she would like to see it, too. So we decided to go on a real date and see *Titanic* together... with her friend, Chrissy, who we'll call Melissa.

The three of us met up at the Geneva Theater on a Saturday afternoon, and my dad bought our tickets for us since the ushers weren't selling them to kids under 13 without parental permission due to the brief depiction of nude boobs. 

We entered the theater and sat in the middle of a row toward the back of a pretty full auditorium. On my left: some fuckin' dude, I dunno. On my right: Whitney. On Whitney's right: Melissa. 

For three hours and 14 minutes we marveled at James Cameron's epic, technological feat of cinema. A story of a completely unfathomable romance between a rich British lady and a hot street urchin, set aboard one of history's most well-known tragedies.[^5] 

For three hours and 14 minutes the three of us watched as the bond between Jack and Rose strengthened as they stood on the bow of the ship, as they twirled around in the underbelly faster and faster, as Jack drew Rose's naked boobs, as there were naked boobs and I suddenly became very self-conscious about seeing naked boobs sitting next to my girlfriend, as the two of them did *something* that created an overabundance of humidity in the back of a car, as they desperately clamored over detritus and through gushing water in an attempt to survive the horror of their ocean liner plunging into the icy Atlantic, as they miraculously survived the burbling whirlpool created by the mass sinking into the ocean, as they floated off into the night, Rose aboard a remarkably buoyant door, Jack hanging onto her, unable to lay beside her without sealing both their fates.

For three hours and 14 minutes I agonized over whether or not I should try and hold my girlfriend's hand in the theater. My little idiot fingers unable to penetrate the barrier wrought of embarrassment and shame that lay between our armrests. Until finally, I realized my hands were up at my face, instinctively trying to shield myself from the gaze of Whitney, of Melissa, of the fuckin' guy next to me. My body slowly contorting itself into a weird little ball, as if trying to force some unlikely implosion. So no one would notice that I was shaking uncontrollably as I watched Rose realize Jack was gone (Whoops! Sorry! *Titanic* spoilers). 

As she choked out, "I'll never let go, Jack," I quivered in my seat, doing my best to choke back the heaving sobs.

"I'll never let go."

But she does. She does let go.[^6] And at that moment, so did I. I relented. I couldn't hide it. I cried. I cried watching Leonardo DiCaprio's lifeless body sink into the black. I cried listening to the haunting, ethereal vocals of "The Hymn to the Sea" as they reverberated amongst the theater walls. I cried as Jack and Rose were, decades later, reunited on the ship that held their love for so long.

And as I dried my eyes while the credits rolled, I looked over and saw Whitney and Melissa looking at me, their faces frozen in—if I'm being charitable—looks of bewildered concern. I sunk lower into my chair, waiting for the fuckin' dude next to me to get up and leave.

As we exited the theater, I walked behind the two of them. They talked and laughed—about what, I couldn't hear. I quietly came to terms with the fact that I had probably seen *Titanic* in the theater for the last time.

I don't remember how much longer my relationship with Whitney lasted after that. Its inevitable demise was never attributed to me losing my shit over a movie.[^7] Let's be real: we were 12! We held hands at Funway! It was never gonna get more serious than that!

Neither one of us were emotionally ready to hold onto that bond until we saw each other once more at the bottom of the sea.

[^1]: Next to losing my virginity in a movie theater while watching *Eight Legged Freaks*, but we're not gonna get into that.
[^2]: Seems pretty fucked up and problematic in hindsight! What was that dude's deal??
[^3]: A ring? A necklace? Maybe a bracelet with her name spelled out on blocks woven into it? Who's to say! That detail is lost to the ages, like a pebble tumbling down a river until it dissolves into nigh imperceptible grains of sand.
[^4]: Like, weird flex but okay, Noel, lmao.
[^5]: Another *Titanic*-related tragedy is that the runaway success of the film partially inspired Michael Bay's *Pearl Harbor*, a movie which portrayed a love triangle set against the backdrop of one of the deadliest attacks on U.S. soil. LOL! Why'd ya do that, buddy??
[^6]: YES, I KNOW SHE MEANT *FIGURATIVELY*.
[^7]: Though, years later, I would hear from Melissa that the one thing she remembered about that experience was looking over at me in the theater as I did my best to hide myself from them. Devastating news at the time.
