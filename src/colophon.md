## Now that I'm not using Squarespace, I feel like I deserve one of them fancy Colophon pages.

I made this website. I'm as shocked as your are.

I learned how to use VS Code, which was a wild experience. I did try Nova on my Mac, and it is quite pretty, but ultimately I was too lazy and just decided to do this on my PC instead.

I built the site using [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). It's hosted on Netlify.

I built it using HTML and CSS. There's a .js config file in the directory. Does that mean I did Javascript? Who knows! I copied and pasted some stuff in there and it seemed to work.

Some of the pages were written in Markdown. Some were written in HTML. There's no rhyme or reason, it was mostly just based on how I was feeling in that moment.[^1]

[^1]: This one is written in Markdown, and this footnote is generated using the [*SUPER FANCY PLUGIN*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-footnote) I figured out how to install and configure all by myself! This is exciting because I am a moron.
