<h2>I may be an introvert, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't love to chat</h2>


<h3><i>Keenan, you seem interesting and/or I really like your work and would like to talk to you!</i></h3>

<p>I crave your validation. Please feel free to drop me a line. <a href="mailto:keenan@gkeenan.co?subject=Oh%20god%2C%20I%20clicked%20the%20link%20on%20your%20site%20and%20now%20my%20email%20app%20opened%20up%20a%20new%20window%20I%20don't%20know%20what%20I'm%20doing%20I'm%20so%20sorry">Email</a> feels a bit more meaningful to me, especially if you’ve got a longer thought you need to get out.</p>

<p>I do have a <a href="https://social.lol/@keenan">Mastodon account</a> despite my <a href="https://gkeenan.co/avgb/hey-so-i-think-i-fucking-hate-the-internet">well-documented distaste for social media</a>. Follow me. Say hello. Boost my toots. Do Mastodon stuff!</p>

<p>I also post my photography on <a href="https://glass.photo/keenan">Glass</a> and <a href="https://vsco.co/gkeenan">VSCO</a> though those aren’t necessarily great communication channels, you know?</p>

<p>If you search hard enough, you may find me on LinkedIn. DO NOT FOLLOW ME ON LINKEDIN.</p>

<p><i><b>I REPEAT: DO NOT FOLLOW ME ON LINKEDIN.</i></b></p><br>

<h3><i>I am experiencing a negative reaction to your work and I really need you to know about it!</h3></i>

<p>If I’ve said or done something harmful to you, someone you know, or a community you are a part of, I do, of course, want to learn and grow and improve. Please let me know via email. I respond well to private communication of this nature, and I will happily listen and process.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you just don’t like my work for subjective reasons, I really don’t need to know that. Rest assured that, over the years, I’ve been lucky to find a group of individuals with a wide array of tastes and perspectives. These are people who know me and know how to deliver critical feedback in a way that is respectful and effective. I ask them for feedback regularly, and I trust them to help me improve.</p>

<p>It’s okay if you don’t like what I do. I am working really hard at internalizing the reality that my art cannot and should not be for everyone.</p><br>

<h3><i>I saw someone talking shit about you somewhere and I want to let you know!</i></h3>

<p>Oh please do not do that! Let’s agree that you can possess this knowledge, but do us both a favor and compartmentalize it into your “Inside Thoughts” folder. Ignorance is bliss.</p><br>

<h3><i>I found you on LinkedIn and it looks like you do consulting work?</i></h3>

<p>Thank you for not following me when you found my LinkedIn profile. I hate that place.</p>

<p>However, yes, I am, in fact, a freelance consultant. I have <a href="https://gkeenan.co/s/Keenan-Schneider-resume.pdf">over 12 years of experience in tech</a>, and the vast majority of my career focused on people-centered solutions. If you need advice or help with strategizing in the areas of Internal Communications, Leadership Development, Employee Engagement, Change Management, and/or Learning & Development, please feel free to send me a <a href="mailto:keenan@gkeenan.co?subject=I%20need%20a%20good%20consultant!&body=%5BPlease%20tell%20me%20about%20your%20organization%2C%20the%20problems%20you're%20trying%20to%20solve%2C%20and%20any%20details%20you%20can%20provide%20about%20the%20scope%2C%20timeline%2C%20and%20budget%20of%20these%20project(s)%5D">serious business email</a>.</p><br>

<h3><i>Would you come on my podcast or perform a public speaking engagement?</i></h3>

<p>Yeah, maybe! I have a lot of experience in both, and I’d be happy to share my thoughts depending on the topic and the audience. Again, email is probably the best bet.</p><br>

<h3><i>Might I interest you in a mutually-beneficial blog cross-posting business opportunity that is sure to drive tons of traffic to your website and 10x your revenue?</i></h3>

<h1><b><i>NO.</i></b></h1>
