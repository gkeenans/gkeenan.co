## Hello. I'm Keenan.

### I'm a visual and verbal artist. I worked in tech until my brain broke. Now I'm focused on creating.

<br>

I long for variety, so I make art in a number of mediums depending on how I feel I can express myself most effectively. 

For example:

### [Writing][6]

I currently write a very good blog, A Very Good Blog. It's very good. I think you'll like it.

### [Photography][1]

My photography is often minimal, abstract, and black & white. But also sometimes not!

### [Voice acting][2]
   
People have liked my voice enough that they have convinced their companies to pay me actual money to narrate stuff for them.

### [Podcasts][3]

I like my voice enough that I have convinced myself that talking into a microphone (unpaid) is still worthwhile.

### [Video essays][5]

In a previous life I thought I wanted to make video essays, but it turns out I *hate* gathering B-roll! Still proud of these lil' guys, though.
