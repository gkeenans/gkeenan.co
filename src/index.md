## Hello. I'm Keenan.

I'm a visual and verbal artist based near Louisville. I used to work in corporate tech before my brain broke. 

Now I'm focusing on creating.

I long for variety, so I make art in a number of mediums depending on how I feel I can express myself most effectively. 

[Photography][1], [voice acting][2], [podcasting][3], [web design][4], even the occassional [video essay][5]! 

Lately, though, I've rediscovered my love for writing, so I decided to rebuild this site to focus mainly on that.

Go ahead and poke around. Read my [blog][6]! It's very good. I think you'll like it.
