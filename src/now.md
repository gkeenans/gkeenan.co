## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Today is **June 20, 2024**. I’m listening to "Doctor Eleven," which is the recurring, triumphant theme that plays through key points in *Station Eleven*. I've basically had it on repeat for days since I finished...

### Watching

rewatching *Station Eleven* for the first time since it came out back in 2021. I think it's maybe the best show I've ever seen, and I don't say that lightly. The second time around hit even harder than the first, and I was able to appreciate it so much more.

### Coding

It’s true! I’ve decided to build upon my disparate HTML/CSS knowledge and learn how to code a website from scratch. In fact, I am currently writing this into a Markdown file in VS Code before I am even remotely ready to launch the redesigned site. How fun! Maybe I'll keep this here as sort of a little remnant for when I actually launch.

### Okay bye for now.
