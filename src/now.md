## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

It is **March 18, 2025**, and the song that is playing right now is "The Fox" by Niki & The Dove.

### Gaming

While I haven't given up on _Kingdom Come Deliverance 2_ by any means, I will say that my progress has been, uh, _hindered_ by the existence of _Monster Hunter Wilds_. I am starting to slow down the latter, so I am looking forward to returning to the former, which I still believe is going to be HARD TO TOP this year.

### Reading

Oh fuck, I'm reading a book? I decided to give [Daredevil: Born Again](https://bookshop.org/p/books/daredevil-born-again-marvel-premier-collection-frank-miller/y5yXWJgTu7FzZ4h2?ean=9781302965983&next=t) a shot. I was never a big comic person, but I've always enjoyed Daredevil as a character, so after I started rewatching the Netflix series, I wanted to take a peek at a big source of inspiration for that show.

Anyway, it's quite good!

### Other stuff

I was featured on Manu's _[People & Blogs](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-keenan)_ recently. I had a lot of fun with it. Maybe you will, too, I dunno, I'm not your mom!

### Okay, bye

The song playing now is "Hard Times" by Paramore.
