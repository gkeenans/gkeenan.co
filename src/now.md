### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Today is **November 2, 2024** and I have once again remembered that this page exists.

### Watching

I recently finished watching *Midnight Mass,* and I gotta say, I was absolutely blown away by it. I've been a Mike Flanagan fan (we call ourselves Fanagans in the Mike Flanagan Fan Club I just made up and I am the only member) for awhile, but had somehow overlooked this series. I was enraptured from episode one, and once Hamish Linklater started performing, I couldn't look away. Holy shit, what a show.

### Playing

The *Monster Hunter Wilds* beta has been a blast and makes me want to play *World* or *Rise* more in anticipation. Otherwise, I started a new playthrough of *Dragon's Dogma 2* and that game still rules so hard.

### Okay, bye for now!

Dinner is almost done and we're gonna watch *X* or *Pearl* tonight. Keep an eye on that [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/gkeenan/) page, y'all.
