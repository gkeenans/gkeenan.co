### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

It is **January 13,2025** I am updating this page specifically so my footer will change the date when the site rebuilds.

Otherwise, not a lot going on. I've been watching a lot of [movies](https://letterboxd.com/gkeenan/), and playing some games, while trying to build up motivation to write more. SORRY, THAT'S JUST HOW THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW.
