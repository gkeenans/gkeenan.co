## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Today is **July 17, 2024** and I am ***SLEEP DEPRIVED.*** I am not currently listening to music, though I did listen to System of a Down's perfect album, *Toxicity,* earlier and, yeah, I mean, it is always a good time.

### Watching

I just finished season three of *Halt & Catch Fire*, and I think it was my favorite season yet. Two wasn't quite as sharp as one felt, but now I'm heading into the fourth and final season expecting to be blown away. Show's great! Wish someone had tried to tell me years ago...

### Making

I wrote about how I enjoy my [Sonos Headphones](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/uh-oh-i-think-i-really-like-the-sonos-ace-headphones/). I've also got a number of drafts in the hopper, as per usual.

Also, Sara Joy [wrote a parody](https://sarajoy.dev/blog/write-websites/) of the "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)" essay/song, and I made a vocal track, and then Robb put the audio to video and [posted it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5UsuZ4DS_Q). Finally, the Internet is fun again!

### Playing

I've been putting a ton of time into [Satisfactory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/) this week with my buddy, Scott. I was initially hesitant, with the 1.0 release just around the corner, but, honestly, it's damn fun. I'm glad we jumped back in.

### Okay bye for now.

I really need a nap.
