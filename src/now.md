## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Today is **August 26, 2024** and I am awake at 3:26 a.m. because I haven't yet fallen asleep and, yeah, that is upsetting.

### Listening

The one saving grace is that Charles made me a playlist to test out my new headphones, and Jesus Christ, this thing is *good*. Get you a friend who knows how to put together a banger playlist. Everyone needs a Charles.

### Watching

Oh, hey, started watching *Veep* again.

### Okay bye for now.

I just needed to update this thing.
