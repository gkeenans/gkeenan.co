## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Today is **October 4, 2024** and I hear nothing except the *Balatro* theme playing in my head. Constantly. It haunts my dreams.

### Writing

I finally, *FINALLY*, finished my essay about my cousin. After years of introspection and weeks and weeks and weeks (and also months!) of work, [it is done](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/ive-missed-sam-for-a-very-long-time-or-pick-your-battles/). I'm proud of how it turned out, and I cannot explain just how touching it has been to receive such lovely messages about it since I published.

### Watching

I've been watching a bunch of movies lately. Check out my Letterboxd profile to see all the activity. My favorite one (excluding my third rewatch of *Past Lives* because that's unfair to every other movie), I think, *Another Round*, with *The Hunt* a close second. Honestly, if Mads Mikkelsen is in it, I'm probably going to like it.[^1]

### Playing

*Balatro*, mostly. Tried getting back into *Horizon Forbidden West* and I feel like I need to give up on that dream. I just don't have much fun with it.

But that's also kinda, like, how things are going for me lately. It's been hard to find a video game that holds my attention. Maybe I'm depressed.

### Learning

Today I hit my 72 day streak of learning German[^2] in Duolingo.

### Okay, bye for now!

Gonna go vacuum the house.
