### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

It is **March 7, 2025**, and—wait, one sec, let me open up Apple Music and figure out what song to play—I am listening to "Synesthesia" by Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness. Terrific.

### Gaming

I am coming up on 83 hours played in *Kingdom Come Deliverance 2* and I am not even close to the end, as far as I can tell. I can't remember the last time I played a game that was this engrossing. Every time I boot it up, all I want to do is savor the experience. It reminds me of how games felt when I was a kid, when my imagination would take over and create possibilities that existed only in my mind. It's truly an all-timer for me, no hyperbole.

ADDITIONALLY, I'm over 30 hours into *Monster Hunter Wilds* and this is the one that finally made *Monster Hunter* truly click for me. I love it so much I want to go back to the old games with my newfound appreciation and see if that carries over. It's so, so good. Some of the most satisfying and exhilarating combat I've ever experienced.

### Website stuff

I look at my list of blog posts and think, "Hmm. How do I help people understand what they're getting into? There's very little thematic cohesion and these titles, while delightful, might instill more choice paralysis than anything."

Anyway, I'm considering of reworking my home page and also adding a new page that serves as a way to guide people to my writing, old and new pieces alike.

### Okay, bye

The song playing now is "Transliterator" by DeVotchKa. (Okay I forgot to publish this so now the song that's playing is "I Wanna Get Better" by Bleachers. OKAY PUBLISHING NOW BYE.)
