## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Today is **July 24, 2024** and against my better judgment, I drank a Red Bull earlier. I am not currently listening to music, since I'm about to hop on a phone call.

### Watching

Nearing the end of *Halt & Catch Fire* and, holy shit, this season wrecked me. I had no idea. It's so good.

Also, I watched the finale of *Presumed Innocent* on Apple TV+ and it was... fine. The show itself was solid, but I'm sort of iffy on how everything wrapped up. Performances were great throughout though.

### Learning

I've pivoted from Portuguese to German for... well, still reasons. We'll see. Maybe I'll switch to Spanish, but, hey, German is fun!

### Okay bye for now.

Excited to dive back into some essay writing after I finish these phone calls.
