## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

It is **October 7, 2025**. I am listening to "SPIDERS" by Lola Young.

### Gaming

Holy shit, so many great games in the last couple months. Can't believe how packed 2025 has been. Currently making my way through *Ghost of Yōtei*, *Silksong*, and *Dying Light: The Beast* while also still playing *Path of Exile 2* regularly.

Also recently played through *Baby Steps* and even [wrote a review on another website](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/09/23/baby-steps-review/)! Spoilers alert: it was a delight.

### Learning

I finished the Lingoda Super Sprint and found out that I passed, which makes me eligible for an additional 60 classes. I ended up with an A2.1 certificate in German, and my goal is to finish the next batch of classes to earn the A2.2 certificate. Should still have some classes leftover to start working on B1.1 material.

### Other stuff

Really pleased with the reception Halsted and I have received on the first few episodes of our new podcast, [*Friendship Material*](https://friendship-material.simplecast.com/). We've had so much fun getting to know each other and making something we both enjoy, so it means the world to hear that so many people connect with it. Big ups to all of you out there!

### Okay, bye
