## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Today is **November 29, 2024** and it has been a *rough* month.

### Watching

This month, we've plowed through *Search Party.* Currently on season four and loving it. Can't believe I had never heard about it until very recently. 

Logged a bunch of movies lately on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/gkeenan/). Feel free to check out my profile.

### Playing

I've been enjoying *Echo Point Nova* quite a bit. Sort of a weird blend of Tribes and Titanfall. Fast, frenetic, smooth movement and combat.

Also started Stalker 2, which made me want to revisit the older games in the series.

Also also, I finally started *Stellar Blade* on PS5. Definitely got a style over substance vibe that permeates the entire experience. The combat is flashy and fun, but pretty shallow. It doesn't hold a candle to anything FromSoftware does.

### Okay, bye for now!

Katy and I decided to put off Thanksgiving cooking until today, so we're gonna get moving on that shortly. Just a nice little day for the two of us. She's taking the lead on this meal, and I'll take the lead on Christmas.
