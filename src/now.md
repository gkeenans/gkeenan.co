### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Today is **December 12, 2024** and my creative motivation is still in the dumps. I'm trying not to beat myself up too much about it, but I can feel the slump weighing on me. I'm sure, with time, things will right themselves, but in the meantime, it's difficult to see past this moment.

Perhaps related to this, I decided today to [pierce my fucking nose](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/i-pierced-my-fucking-nose/) again. Once things heal up, I'll do a little double hoop action, but for now, [I've got two studs](https://social.lol/@keenan/113641181756534628).

### Watching

Still watching *Search Party.* Nearing the end of the series, but taking our time. It's great. 

I've also been enjoying the latest season of *Shrinking* and *What We do in the Shadows*. Oh, and *Day of the Jackal* has been solidly entertaining.

I recently rewatched *Interstellar,* and it made me cry harder than any time before. Maybe I should go back to therapy and start unpacking that!

### Playing

After an uncharacteristic lull, a few games have come out recently that have sort of taken over all of my attention. Here's a list:

*Stalker 2* — The vibes are so, so good. Unforgiving, bleak, but immensely rewarding for anyone who likes open worlds that encourage thoughtful exploration.

*Cairn* — Right now, just a demo available on Steam (until December 19). No game I've played has ever captured the magic of rock climbing like this. It went from being something I was curious about to basically my most anticipated game of 2025. I've played this demo over and over and over. Can't wait to climb the whole mountain.

*Path of Exile 2* — This just came out in Early Access and I've been playing a ton of it with my wife. The couch co-op experience has been stellar, despite the fact that beta bugginess sometimes rears its ugly head.

*Indiana Jones and the Great Circle* — Maybe the most pleasant surprise of the year? I wasn't expecting this to be any good, but it's honestly a remarkable feat. A game that manages to make sneaking around in first person an exhilarating adventure, and it is absolutely gorgeous to look at. What a great time!

### Okay, bye for now!

I want to write more. I do. I've got the drafts started, but I'm going to let my brain rest for a bit.
