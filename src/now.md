## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Lmao, it is **June 30, 2025**, and the last time I update this page was in March. Ope!

### Gaming

In the last few months I have played a couple *absolute bangers*.

I finished *Kingdom Come Deliverance 2* and now I'm considering playing through it again. It's incredible.

I played *Monster Hunter Wilds* and *Blue Prince* and *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* and they are all experiences I'll be thinking about for a long, long time. Holy shit, maybe I should just write a whole post about 2025's killer video games so far.

Anyway, now I am neck deep into *Death Stranding 2* and—wow, shock, surprise, awe—it rules hard.

### Reading

This year, I decided to read a few graphic novels. I read and enjoyed all of these:

- *Daredevil: Born Again*
- *Batman: Year One*
- The Matt Fraction run of *Hawkeye*

Now I am currently reading *Fluent Forever* by Gabriel Wyner to help my ongoing quest to learn German.

### Other stuff

I guess the big news is that I started a new podcast??? It's been a couple months in the making, and probably one of the reasons I've been less website-focused. Anyway, it's called *Friendship Material* and it's very nice. You can read more about it (and subscribe) on the [brand new page I built](https://gkeenan.co/podcasts/). Fancy!

### Okay, bye

The song playing now is "Breathing the Same Air" by Petey USA.
