## Now.

### What the hell is this?
Wow, what an aggressive question.

It's a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. I saw [Robb](https://rknight.me/now/) do it, so I wanted to, too.

I'm very impressionable.

Look, basically, this is a glimpse into what I’m focused on in this moment. It’s a nice way for me to reflect on the things I enjoy, and also helps paint a picture for others who maybe want to get to know me better.

Cool? Cool.

### Hi

Today is **July 6, 2024**. I’m listening to "Boom Boom Back" by Hinds & Beck, which is brand new to me, and I am delighted my Apple Music station served it up.

### Watching

Hot on the heels of rewatching *Station Eleven,* just a couple weeks ago, I decided it was time to rewatch *Station Eleven* again because I bought the 4K Blu-ray. I know. I have a problem, but it's just so fucking good. I honestly cannot remember the last time I wanted to watch something so much. I am normally not that person.

### Writing

I launched the site and wrote a [big whole thing about it](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/an-alarmingly-concise-and-very-hinged-summary-of-what-it-was-like-to-build-this-site-from-scratch/). Learning to code was a wildly fun and addictive experience, and I've had a blast continually tinkering with the new site in VS Code since I launched it a week or so ago.

### Playing

I am once again trying to get into Monster Hunter. I booted up Monster Hunter Rise, and made it much further than I did before. It's fun! But I don't know if it quite hooks me like it does with some people.

### Okay bye for now.

Apple Music has decided to play "i haven't felt like me" by PRONOUN, which is another song that's brand new to me.
