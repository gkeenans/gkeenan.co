## Inexplicably, some people enjoy hearing me talk.

### Here are the current active shows I make that you can (and should???) listen to. I dunno, do what you want, I'm not your mom.

### [A Very Good (Audio) Blog][1]

![image](/assets/img/podcasts/avgab.png)

My blog, your ears. I make audio companions to some (but not all) of my writing. 

Get it on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-very-good-audio-blog/id1724269695) or [read along on my site][1].

New episodes sporadically.

### [Friendship Material][2]

![image](/assets/img/podcasts/friendshipmaterial.png)

I made a new friend, and one of the conditions of our continued friendship is that we podcast about it. What started as a fun experiment has blossomed into a wholesome, authentic, and sometimes silly show where two adults navigate the vast and lonely world of trying to connect with new people when you're gettin' old.

Get it on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/friendship-material/id1823544686) (or, again, your favorite podcast app or whateverâ€”you know the drill I bet), or, like, [listen in your browser][2]? That's also an option!

New episodes every other Monday.
