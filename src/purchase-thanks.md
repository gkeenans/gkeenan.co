## Wow, thank you!

#### To help me get your file sent to you in a timely manner, please follow these simple instructions



### Non-optional steps:
 1. [Email me](mailto:keenan@gkeenan.co?subject=Hi!%20Please%20send%20me%20a%20photo!) with a direct link (or at least a screenshot) to the photograph(s, if you purchased multiples) in question.
 2. Wait patiently for me to track down the file and send it over to you.

### Optional steps:
1. Use the photograph as a nice wallpaper for your phone, or a new conversation piece that really ties the room together!
2. Send me a photo of my photo where you're showcasing it. I'm curious and I think it would be fun to see what you do with my art!

***Also I ask again that you only use this photo for your own personal purposes. Please do not be rude and try to resell my work in any way, shape, or form.***

***Thank you! Your support means the world to me.***
