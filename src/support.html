<h2>Look. I'm just an artist trying to make it all work.</h2>

<h4>If you want to help support me, here's how you can.</h4>

<h3>Share</h3>
<p>First off, something simple and easy you can do is share my work. Maybe it's a photo. Maybe it's a blog post. I dunno, it's just really nice that you like my stuff enough to give it a boost.</p>

<h3>Subscribe</h3>
<p>Subscribe to my projects via RSS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Very Good Blog</li>
    <li>A Very Good (Audio) Blog (RSS / Apple Podcasts / Or wherever you get your podcasts)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also on <a href="https://social.lol/home">Mastodon</a> (for some reason) and <a href="https://glass.photo/keenan">Glass</a> (to share photos).</p>
<p>Also also there's this cute lil <a href="https://keenan.omg.lol/">omg.lol page</a> that has a bunch of other links to other places I exist around the web.</p>

<h3>Survive</h3>
<p>Capitalism is broken. You know it. I know it. <i>We all know it.</i> I would love to be able to fix it. However, I am but a single moron, so I'm just trying to survive it.</p>
<p>If you feel compelled to reward my work with a monetary donation, that's so friggin nice. I could not be more grateful.</p>
<p>Feel free to use this Ko-Fi widget.</p>

<p>My Ko-Fi page is also where I host my Print Shop, so if you would like something more tangible in exchange for your cash, might I suggest a very lovely and unique photo to hang on your wall?</p>
