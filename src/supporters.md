## Behold! The Hall of Glorious Supporters!

### The lovely and generous folks who support what I do

Look, I'm just gonna be honest and say I never really anticipated anyone to take me up on the offer to toss a lil' bit of money my way, but some of you have, and that's, like, incredibly nice. I'm still in disbelief that my work has connected with you in a way that compelled you to do it, so I wanted to show my gratitude by taking a brief moment to feature *you.*[^1]

*Do you see your name on here and super hate it? Sorry! [Drop me a line](mailto:keenan@gkeenan.co?subject=Get%20my%20name%20outta%20your%20site's%20mouth) and I'll make it disappear.*

*Did I forget you? Did I misspell something? Did I link the wrong thing? Fuck! Please [suggest a correction](mailto:keenan@gkeenan.co?subject=I%20am%20disappoint%20(please%20fix)) and I will take care of it ASAP.*
