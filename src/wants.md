## Wants

### Lovingly stolen from [Katherine](https://kayserifserif.place/intentions/): “A list of intentions; a poem; the ‘I want’ song; not a bucket list——”

I want to make my own fashion;

I want to be brave enough to wear (something like) this;

I want to write a book (the longest dream I’ve ever held);

I want to live in Montana;

I want to live in Portugal (Lisbon);

I want to live off the land;

I want my photographs featured in the lobby of a building; in someone’s collection;

I want to feel a sense of purpose; a calling;

I want to inspire people (not machines) to create;
